    <p>Sindbad welcomed his guest, the por-ter as usual, and gave some eatables and grape-juice. The porter drank the juice and was relaxing on the cushion-seat beside Sindbad.</p>
    <p>Sindbad, the sailor began telling his story-</p>
    <p>Though my third adventure was lasted a month ago, I could not sit idle. So, I thought of going on a voyage once more. Just then, I met some merchants who were about to go on a voyage. I took large packs of goods and started with them from Basora port. This was my fourth voyage and the sea too was he fourth.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the voyage itself,we had to face a great storm. A strong wind blew and overturned our hip. While the ship was sinking, four f us could caught a wooden-plank and e9an peddling it with our legs. We Celled like that for three days without food and water. On the fourth day we reached an island. We searched he,, and there and got some fruits and root to eat. We were very much tired am hence slept there for a while. Afterward we began wandering around the island Shortly, we were surrounded by a gan of nude-people. They forced us to follow them. They took us to a large thatched shed. They didn't do any harm to us. They gave us plenty of food and water. Feeling something uneasy due to some bad omens prevailing in my mind, I didn’t even touch them. Peculiarly, they gave us coconut-oil too to drink. The rest of my friends ate the full-meal and drank the oil too. By drinking the oil they became fatty. They were the man-eating tribes men. They select the fattiest man and kill him. They offer the dead-man to their king. Af-ter cooking the dead-man in a big pot he will enjoy the feast. The king alone eats the cooked meat, others eat raw meat.</p>
    <p>Nearly for five or six days, I ate some fruits and drank water just to survive. Afterwards they took us to their King who was sitting on a decorated stone-seat. A big pot was beside him. A few bones were nearby. My guessing was correct. Their intention was to kill and eat all of us one by one. I felt sorry for my friends because they lost the power of memory and rea-soning tool By eating the meager food, I becama very weak. But my friends became verj fatty. Leaving me to the last, they killed my three friends one by one. So, I found time to plan for escaping from there.</p>
    <p>I began praying to God in my heart to relieve me from the tribes men. One day, while I was wandering on the sea-shore, I met an oldman. He asked me why I was there. Then I told him all about our ship-wrecking and reaching the island. I told him about the death of my three friends too. Hearing my story, he pitied me and took me to a town eight miles away from there. Then I thought that God had come to my rescue in the form of the oldman. As I had no proper food for days together, and walked a great distance, I fell senseless for a while. There, the people helped me to get my senses and gave me food and Water. They gave me good dress too, to wear. They all seemed to be noble and kind-hearted. Horse-riding was a common thing there but with a pe-culiarity. They didn’t know about the use of briddle, rein, and the saddle in the horse-riding. When I asked the king why they were not using them, the king could not understand what the terms mean.</p>
    <p>Then I explained them to the king “The rein with the briddle is used to control the horse and. the saddle is a cushion seat of leather which is used to sit upon the horse comfortably.”</p>
    <p>On the request of the king I prepared a set of the rein and the saddle. I took help from the local black¬smith and the cobler to prepare them. Then the king made a trial-run with the new equipment and felt great pleasure in riding. He gave me many presents for my craftmanship, and re-quested me to stay there for ever. Soon, the courtiers as well as the local people came to me asking for the new articles. I almost became a saddler by the new Profession. So, I engaged some people to make them. The new profession brought me great profits. By the king’s order a beautiful girl was given to me in marriage. As she was from a rich family she brought some gold and money with her. A beauti-ful house was given to us by the family. We were spending the wedded-life Joyfully.</p>
    <p>As days were passing, suddenly epidemics broke out in that town. My wife too died along with many other people. While I was in grief with the loss, there came another trouble for me. If any one of a couple dies (either man of woman), the other too should die alone) with the dead.</p>
    <p>According to their custom, they tied me with my dead-wife and took me to the well of death. Then they threw me along with the corpse into the well. They threw some packages of food and water containers after me. Then the well was closed with a large slab of stone. There was no water in the well. There were heaps and heaps of rotten corpses. In the darkness I heard.two or three people groaning among the heaps; perhaps they were the still alive! I dragged some corpses aside and made room for me. Due to the bad smell that prevailed there, I could not eat or drink anything for three days. But later on be-gan to eat a little only to survive and pro-long death. Oneday, I heard a scratching sound from outside. Then an idea struck to me- I took a long bone and began dig-ging the wall from inside. My efforts were not gone waste! A ray of light entered the well. That was the ray of my life. I made the hole big enough to go through it. I reached outside and looked around. I reached a mountain slope and saw the sea nearby. I thanked God for showing me a way out of the well. I stood there for a while, breathing fresh-air. Then, again I entered the well and collected all the golden-ornaments that were on the dead- bodies and came out for ever.God alone knows, how could I bear the rotten-smell and lived there for a week.</p>
    <p>A few hours later, a ship came into my view. I brought some coloured rags too from the well for packing the golden orna-ments. I took out some of them and waved them with my hand to the sailors. By luck, they got my signal and sent a small boat for me. I got on to it and reached the ship. Then the captain asked me “No living be-ing dares to come to the hill! How did you come there?” Then, I told him everything about my voyage, the wrecking of the ship and about the well of death.</p>
    <p>They left me at Basora port and went away. From there, I reached my home in Baghdad. The gold which I brought from the well, fetched me a large amount. For-merly I was rich, by adding the value of the gold I became the richest man in the town. People began to call me as 'Pasha' (a King).</p>
    <p>Please take these gold coins as a gift for hearing my story! Be sure to come tomorrow” he said to porter Sindbad.</p>
