    <p>Next day, porter Sindbad went to the Sailor’s house. He welcomed him and gave him some fruits and wine. Then he started telling the porter about the 2nd voyage.</p>
    <p>“For some months I was in Baghdad doing nothing but spending money lavishly. It became boresome for me to sit idly. So, I purchased some merchandise and started my 2nd voyage on a ship. On the way, I used to sell my goods and began purchasing new goods at cheaper rates. In this way, our business went well for a long time. We all got great profits. At one of the islands, we anchored the ship and got down to see the wonders there. There were plenty of gardens and water-pools in the island. But we could not trace any man there. Seeing the beauty of nature, eating the fruits and drinking the water, I went ahead of my friends. I slept under a tree for a while. When I woke up, I could not find my friends, more over it was becomng dark. So, I went back running to the sea-shore. The ship went away leaving me alone on the island.</p>
    <p>I began scolding myself for sleeping there senselessly for a long time. While wandering in the island, I found a large round and white object just before me. It was greater in size than a man-so it should not be an egg-then what it might be? In the morning, I went near it to have a close look. Suddenly, it became dark and a creeking noise was heard. I shuddered with fear, a very large bird was coming down. At once, I climbed up the tree and began watching it. The bird flew down and sat on the round object. Then I confirmed it to be the egg of that bird. The bird closed its eyes and was sleeping. Then I slowly went to the bird, and with my turban I tied myself to its claws. The leg was as big as a trunk of a tree. After a while, it flew up and with it, I too flew high into the clouds.</p>
    <p>After some time it came down and rested on a hill. 1 at once unfastened the turban from its claws and ran to a big rock and hid  valley. On either side there were great mountains. The only way out for me was going up with the bird, as done while coming there. As I was think-ing and ooking around, I found some stones glittering in the valley. They were all diamonds, glittering by the sun-shine. Just then I heard a peculiar sound and looked that side. I found a great snake of the size of a palm-tree coming towards me. The bird saw it from a distance. It came down and picked it up With its claws, and flew away. There were many great snakes in the valley. Generally they won’t come out during day-time. If I stayed there for the night, the snakes would surely kill me. So, I thought it better to go away with the large bird any away.</p>
    <p>Just then, I heard the thud-sound of something falling on the ground. It was a large piece of meat. In no time, a large bird came down and took it away. Like that, one after one bird was coming down and taking the meat away. Some people were on the hills. They frightened the bird with the sounds of beating the drums. The bird left the piece of meat on the hill and was waiting nearby. The men collected the diamonds that stuck to the meat and threw away the piece again to the bird to eat. An idea struck to me. I tied myself to a bird’s leg as before. I had with me some diamonds collected in the valley. When the bird was going' up with the piece of meat, I picked up all the diamonds from the meat and kept them with my former collection.</p>
    <p>Soon the bird reached the top of the mountain. The people began beating drums. I unfastened the turban and caught the piece of meat. Then the bird dropped it on the hill. People came running there to collect the dia-monds. But to their great dismay, I was with the piece of meat and not the dia-monds. A man came to me and asked “Who are you? How do you come here?” Over whelmed with joy on seeing a man after some months, I could not answer him at once. Afterwards, I told him all about myself. He called me as a dare-devil and took me with him to his house. He treated me kindly and affectionately with Royal- honours. I presented him with some of the diamonds.</p>
    <p>On my request, he agreed to arrange for my return journey to Baghdad. I sold away some diamonds and purchased vari-ous new goods for my business. I thanked the large bird for saving me and bringing me up from the valley. Afterwards, I started with my merchandise on the ship and reached Baghdad.</p>
    <p>Thank you for hearing my story pa-tiently. Please take these gold-coins as a gift from God and not from me. Don’t for-get to come here tomorrow to hear about my third voyage.”</p>
    <p>Porter Sindbad reached home and was taking rest on a cot just before his hut. A crow was sitting on the wall, before him. It was larger than the other crows. It was jet- black in colour and had a long and strong beak. It might be a demon-crow. It was changing its size. It was looking at him, perhaps it would attack him and kill him. What was to be done? could he go, any where to hide? It was impossible to es-cape from its attack. In order to escape from it, he slowly crawled on the ground and was about to enter his hut. Suddenly, the crow flew down and caught him with its claws. It was going up with him. His heart began to beat like a drum. He closed his eyes due to fear. It was flying too high.</p>
    <p>Breathing became difficult for him. He opened his eyes and looked downwards. A great sea was beneath him. He was fear-ing that at any moment the crow would kill him and eat him. “A large bird and a small prey. Why this bird is after me? I haven’t done it any harm. Why this bird is carry-ing me awav?” I began fo discuss in my heart of hearts. Soon hot air swept all over. I looked down and found great mountains instead of sea. One of the mountains was burning with great flames and smoke. The lava was flowing as a river. The bird flew higher and speedier than before, perhaps for the unbearable heat. I began to pray God to save me. At last, we entered a cool and calm atmosphere. The bird was flying and flying but not stopping anywhere. All of a sudden, the bird let loose its claws. I began falling. I cried Allah! and prayed him to save me”.</p>
    <p>He fell on the ground and was still alive.He opened his eyes. He could not find any bird or anything. Then he under-stood that he fell from the cot to the floor in his dream. He drank a glass full of wa-ter and slept again.</p>
