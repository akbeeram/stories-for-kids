    <p>Porter Sindbad did not turn up. So Sindbad was feeling uneasy. A story teller needs a good listener who hears the story without questioning in between. Porter Sindbad was that type. He hears patiently without diverting his attention. </p>
    <p>He already heard four, still remained only three, I won’t and can’t say more than the three stories. Why didn’t hecome? Why is he making me annoyed?” While he was thinking so, the porter came there. Sindbad gave him some biscuits to eat and wine to drink. After that, he began telling his story.</p>
    <p>“We started on a ship for our 5th voyage. Going along the sea-coast, our ship visited many new places. Everywhere, our business went well. Oneday, we went into an island.Its name was Ape-town. Every-day, by evening thousands of large mon-keys used to come down from the mon-key-hill there. Fearing the monkeys, the people leave their houses at the evening and spend the whole night in boats in the sea. This became a routine for them. Early the next morning, they return to their homes. I went into the town to find out the truth.On my return from that,town, I could not find my ship. They left me there and went away. I was looking around for some possible help to go away from there. Just then, a man came to me and took me to his boat. I spent with him the whole night in the boat telling him the stories of my adventures. Soon we became good friends. In the morning we went into the town. He gave me a bag full of pebbles and took me to the monkey-hill. There were a great number of monkeys on the trees. On his advice, I began to throw the pebbles at the monkeys. Thus, both of us threw as many pebbles as possible at them. In return, the monkeys, were throw-ing coconuts at us. We collected all the, coconuts and returned home. Like that, I spent many nights in my friend s boat and was going daily to the monkey-hill to collect the coconuts.</p>
    <p>A fortnight later, a big vessel came to that place. The captain of the ship allowed me to travel in his ship with an my coconuts. We reached a strange island. The people of that place took all my coconuts and gave diamonds in exchange. They pay a high price for it because it was a rare- fruit there. By that business, I got a thou-sands of diamonds. Adding to my former wealth, the diamonds made me a great millionaire.</p>
    <p>Buying things at cheaper rates selling them with a higher rate at other places was the business. If managed well, business by ship fetches great returns Dear friend! Please keep one thing in mind-by the grace of God alone I came through successful in business. Other-wise, I should have faced death either in the hands of the giant or in the well of death. A few days later, I reached Baghdad. My friends and well-wishers welcomed me with great honours.</p>
    <p>Please take these diamonds and gold coins as a gift from Allah! Be sure to be here tomorrow!” said Sindabad, the sailor.</p>
