    <p>After the fifth voyage, I spent nearly five months in Baghdad. Though I had every-thing to enjoy I could not get satisfaction. Adventures in the form of voyages thrill a man more than anything.
        So, I began to plan for my sixth voyage. I collected many new articles and packed them in large bundles. A ship came to Basora port and on my request, the sailors accepted to take me and my goods with them. When I en-tered the ship my joy knew no bounds, most of the sailors were my old friends.</p>
    <p>Our voyage was going on well for a few days. All of our goods were sold and everyone of us was happy with great profits. One day, suddenly the captain cried aloud and said “Get out of the ship at once. The ship has been broken by the stones un-derneath the sea.” In no time a creeking sound and then a cracking sound were heard. The ship was smashed to pieces. Some of my friends died being struck to the stones. Very few of us could reach the shore by the high tides. The land which we reached was the Treasure-island’, For merely many ships were smashed by the stones there and all the wealth of that de-stroyed ships, reached this island. Hence the island got that name. Valuable articles, gold coins, furniture, carcasses etc. were among the heaps there. But we found no living creature there. There was no drink-ing water and no food available. Due to lack of the prime necessities many of our team members faced death.</p>
    <p>I was the only one survived there. Trying to go away from there, was better than dying there with hunger. An idea struck to me-l collected some wooden planks and some small pieces and tied them together with the tur-bans of my dead- friends. Then there was a float ready for me. I gathered some gold coins, and other valuables from the heaps and tied them in a bundle. I sat on the float with it and began sailing on the sea. Two flat pieces of wood helped me as oars. I don’t know then, where the float was tak-ing me to. First it passed through a slope of a mountain and then it entered Q tun-nel. I could not sit erect on the float in the tunnel. So, I laid down flat on the float. In that position I got sleep. I couldn’t guess for how long did I slept on it. When I woke up, I was on an island. Some black-faced people surrounded me and asked me something in their own language. I could not understand their language. I could only guess that they were asking my details. So I tried to explain them partly through signs and using my mother- tongue Ara-bic. There were some people who knew Arabic. So they explained the others about my story. They gave me some food and water and treated me kindly. A majority of them were all farmers. They were doing some farm work nearby. They appreciated my daring adventure and took me to their king. After introduction, I told my story to the king. He developed a great liking for me. So he requested me to stay there for ever with them. Not even one month had passed, then a ship came to that island. It was going through the port of Basora to an another port. I requested the king to permit me to go on that ship. I presented him some valuable presents that were brought from the treasure island. In return he gave some great presents to me and some to our king in Baghdad.</p>
    <p>Soon after reaching Baghdad, I went direct to the king, and handed over the given presents along with some of mine. Our king gave a very fine reception for me and ordered the courtiers to write my story as history. As a token of love, he gave me a number Of presents of the royal nature. From then onwards, I began to live almost like a king.</p>
    <p>Porter Sindbad said “Sea-travel (voy-age) is full of perils. Sea causes death to many. Yet, again and again you venture into the sea for business-why?”</p>
    <p>Sailor Sindbad laughed and said “Yes, I have enough wealth to enjoy life¬long. But, now, leaving the earning aspect, I want tc learn more about the new places and the strange people there. Journey thrills a man, more than anything. There are plenty of wonders to see in the world, witnessing them is a great delight. After becoming old, we could not do anything. Perils, dangers, deaths-these will come anywhere either on land or sea. All hap- pens according to the wish of God. Water is more important for our livelihood, but if it is too much, it will kill us. Air is essential for us to breath, but if it comes with a great force in the form of a storm or a typhoon-it kills people, animals and I trees too.</p>
    <p>Take these gold-coins and dry-fruits I from me, the servant of God. Please don’t forget to come tomorrow and to hear my last and the final story of the 7th voyage” said Sindbad, the sailor.</p>
