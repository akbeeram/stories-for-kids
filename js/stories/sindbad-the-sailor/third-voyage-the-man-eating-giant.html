    <p>Sindbad gave his daily-guest some wine and fruits and began telling his story.</p>
    <p>“With the experiences of my second voyage I decided not to venture again in to the sea. The wealth was more than enough for me to lead a joyful life everafter. The profits in the trade and the diamonds I had with me, made me a great wealthy man. So I thought it would be better to stay at home and enjoy the life peacefully.</p>
    <p>Months passed and I began vexing the idle-life. The curiosity in me arose to see more countries and earn a great knowledge. I began purchasing new commodities and got ready for the next voyage. I ship with my goods. Like the other merchants, I too sold my goods at various ports on the way and used to buy new goods. Every one of us has got heavier profits. So we were all feeling happy.</p>
    <p>One day our ship was caught by a typhoon. Our ship began to shiver like a toy boat. By the force of the wind and the tides our ship was taken to an island. Soon, the captain said “We are in the wrong route. I think we are very near to the monkey mountain. Be cautious! The monkeys are the only inhabitants there. They have black-eyes and sharp teeth. Their body will be full of long-hair.”</p>
    <p>Suddenly hundreds of them attacked our ship. The sails were torn, wires and ropes were cut and masts were broken. Our ship was smashed before our eyes. We could not do anything. We lost the ship and so began wandering in the island. No human being was living there. We went far ahead and found a fort-like building on a hill. As the gates were open, we went into it. Nobody was there. In the main hall, there was a stone-bench and very near to it we found some bones and ashes of fire. To get away from the weariness, we slept there.</p>
    <p>A little time later, we found a great thundering sound and it made us to get up from the sleep. A great giant was before us. His eyes were burning red in color and ears were as large as the elephant's ears.</p>
    <p>Long sharp teethe exposed outside and his strong hands had very long nails. Seeing the fearful stature we ran to a corner and were shivering with fear. He stretched his hand and caught me frist and smelt all over my body. Perhaps he might have thought that I was very weak and tossed me aside and picked up a strong man from us. He twisted his neck and killed him. He then pierced a long fork into the body. He made a fire and toasted the dead man. Then he began eating him. We could not look at the fearful sight. So we went to a far corner and wept bitterly. After his meal was over, the giant went to the stone-bench and slept there.</p>
    <p>Then began our plans to escape from there. A friend suggested “If we collect some wood and make a float, we can go into the sea. Dying in the hands of the gi-ant is worse; the best way is going away while he was asleep.” Then I said “First we have to make him blind while he was asleep.” There by we sharpened two long sticks at one end
        and burnt them read-hot. Two of us took them to him and thrusted them in the eyes at the siime time. He roared and became wild with the pain. He caught one of us and dashed him against the wall. He went outside and began to cry aloud.1 In the meanwhile we collected some logs and sticks and tied them to-gether with the wild-creepers and made a float. One by one we left the place silently and took the float with us to the sea-shore. As we were going on the water with the float, somehow he heard the sound of oars in the water. He beagan showering stones upon us from a height. Two of our freinds died on the spot by the stones.</p>
    <p>With great difficulty, we could go far into the sea. Nearly a week we were on the float. There was no protection for s from wind, rain and sun-shine. Horrible cold at nights and unbearable heat at daytimes made three of us die.</p>
    <p>Two more people died due to thirst and hunger. Finally, three including me could reach an island. Our joy knew no bounds, there were many trees with fruits. We ate the fruits and drank the water in a small pond. As we were thinking of taking rest, we heard a great hissing noise. We looked at the other side and found a great python there.</p>
    <p>It caught one of our friends and devoured him in no time. I and my freind ran searching for a place of safety. At last we climbed up a big tree and slept on the branches for the night. At midnight crushing sound of bones was heard. I woke up and found my friend missing. The pthon must have ate him too. In the morning, I got down from the tree and went towards the sea. I saw a ship in the open and waved my hands at them. The captain of the ship asked me why I was there lonely. Then I told them all about my journey.</p>
    <p>The captain said “We are merchants. After the sale of our goods we will start the return journey. In the meanwhile, you too can sell some of the goods and get a share in the profits. The rest will go to the family members of the owner. By bad luck, the owner had vanished since some months”.</p>
    <p>I looked at the merchandise. My joy had no limits- All the packs of goods were, in my name. The ship was the same which left me sleeping in an island.</p>
    <p>“Hallo captain! I am Sindbad, the owner of the goods. You left me in the island un-noticed. Due to my ill-health, I became weak.So you could not recognise me.”I told him. Then one of the other merchants came to me and shook hands. He said “Yes, you are Sindbad! I recognised you. You have given me diamonds which you have brought from the valley." The captain requested him to excuse him. Because of his fault, Sindbad had to face many difficulties.</p>
    <p>"Fate decides everything, we can't oppose its decision. There's nothing wrong on your side. Anyhow, I could escape death and meet you all. I thank God for this re-union. Forget everything about the past. Feel happy and proceed further,” said I.</p>
    <p>We reached Basora and from there to Baghdad. As usual, my friends gave me a great reception.</p>
    <p>This time, the experiences enhanced my belief in God. By His help only, I could over come great troubles.</p>
    <p>God alone had saved me from the giant-trio-the large bird, the python and the demon (giant), otherwise, I should have been killed some-where unnoticed.</p>
    <p>I used to live a luxurious and pleasant life in Baghdad. I earned more than enough wealth. I had no relatives and no family members to feed. So I began feed-ing the poor and needy.”</p>
    <p>Porter Sindbad had some doubts. He said “Voyage on sea is not at all good. We have to face many perils such as the ty-phoons, the pirates and the large-fishes. There would be no safety for the lives. You have earned great wealth, then why do you venture again into the sea ?"</p>
    <p>"In each voyage we can see many new places and new wonders and new acquaintances. All these thing tempt me to go on a voyage again and again. After a few month's stay at home, I become disgusted and hence start for a new voyage.</p>
    <p>You have heard my story. Take these diamonds and gold coins as a gift not from me but from God. According to his widh only, I am giving them to you. Please don't forget to come tomorrow to hear the story of my fourth voyage."</p>
    <p>Porter Sindbad reached home and had a great meal. He drank some wine too. He got to sleep early than before.</p>
    <p>He was travelling ina large boat as the only passenger. Water, water! every where there was the blue-water of the sea. Wave after wave was coming close to the boat but soon it was returning. They were not harming either him or his boat, he thought that a great force may be that of God, might be protecting him.</p>
    <p>He closed his eyes on seeing a high a | tide. His oar slipped off from his hand; and drifted away by the waves. He lost control over the boat. It” began moving in a clumsy way due to the heavy winds. The light began to fade and his fear was growing. In a short time, it became complete dark. He could not even recognise what was there in just two yards ahead. Adding to his troubles, it be-gan to rain heavily. He lost jj hopes of his living anymore. He became wet all over and was shivering with cold. Water entered the boat. A boat, shouldbe in water, but water should never be in the boat. He thought that his death was fast approach-ing. The boat turned upside down and he fell into the sea. The waves were pulling him inside. He cried a great yell.</p>
    <p>He opened his eyes but could not find either the boat or the sea. He drank some water and slept again. It was nothing but a dream.</p>
