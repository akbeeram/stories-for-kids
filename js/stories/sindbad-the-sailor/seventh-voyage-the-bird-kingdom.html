    <p>As it was the last and the final adventure. Porter Sindbad camb to Sindbad the sailor’s house earlier than before. He wore a fine dress and came with a bunch of fra-grant flowers. He presented them to the sailor and wished him a happy-birthday. (The porter was informed earlier, about his birth-day by the Sailor himself.) The sailor rose from his seat and embrassed the porter with great pleasure. He then offered him a plate full of sweets and cookies to eat. After that, both drank the grape-juice.</p>
    <p>After taking rest for a while, Sindbad, the sailor began telling the story of his last adventure.</p>
    <p>“My life was going on well with all the pleasures. Days, months and years passed. It was perhaps the 3rd year after the sixth voyage, I began to feel that I have travelled centuries ago. The desire to travel again grew to a greater degree. I disliked sitting idle. So, I purchased a lot of new goods and rented a big vessel for my voyage. Some other sailors too fol-lowed me in the ship. For the first few days, our business went on well. As usual, we were selling our goods and buying new goods at various ports. One day, suddenly a storm attacked our ship. The ship was going in an unknown route. Our captain said “We are now at a very dangerous spot. Here are great whales in the sea. They can easily devour the whole ship. The giant fishes may cause havoc to our ship. If a fish hits the ship with its tail, the ship will be no more. “Just then, our ship began to swing on all sides. We under-stood that the giant fishes were very near the ship. A giant fish came into view-which was nearly twenty feet high above the wa-ter. Soon it smashed our ship with its tail. We all fell into the water. Many of my friends were eaten away bu the whales. By luck, I could catch a wooden-plank and was drifting along with it. I used my hands as oars and travelled a great distance. At last I reached a nice island soon.</p>
    <p>There were large trees full of fruits and there was a stream of fresh water. I ate the fruit and drank the water. I feared to stay there alone. So, I collected some logs of wood and made a float, by binding them together with the available creepers. I got on to it and began peddling it with a flat piece of wood. My float was moving with uncontrollable speed. I travelled on it for three days in the sea and entered a big stream. After a few hours’ journey, I found some p©opl© on th© bank. I call©d them by clapping my hands. They saw me and drew me to the bank with their nets. My position was worse than ever before. I could not even stand steadily. An old man came to my rescue. He took me with him to his house and gave me, good food to eat. He began to look after me with great care and affection. It took four days to re-gain my normal health. One day, he came, to me and asked me to sell away my goods. Then I told him that had no goods at all. He then pointed out that the float on which I came there, costs a greater amount, as it was all sandal-wood. He kept them for me with great care. I was stunned to hear his words. He gave me ten thou-sand gold-coins towards their cost. </p>
    <p>Afterwards, on one day he said “I be-came old. I have no sons but I had only a daughter. Please marry her and enjoy my property for ever. “I accepted his request and married his daughter. We were living happliy there. One day, the old man came to me and said”Dear Sindbad, I won’t live for more than a week. After my death, all my wealth would be yours. Please take away my daughter and wealth to Baghdad.”</p>
    <p>Exactly, on the seventh day the old man died. Then a great wonder of wonders happened there. All the villagers were turned into birds and flew away. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Upto that time, I have never witnessed such a great wonder. But, my wife remained as a woman. She said “My father and I are the only people here. All the rest are birds who were transformed as people.”</p>
    <p>I started on a boat and reached a ship in the sea with my wife and the wealth of the old man. We reached Basora port and from there to Baghdad in about five days. The king as well as my friends welcomed me with great royal honours.</p>
    <p>Now, my life has been changed with the coming of my wife. I lost the freedom!of living a single-life. Now, I have to look af-ter my wife. I have more than enough wealth to enjoy. My desire to travel over the seven seas was fulfilled. Those trav-els are enough for my life. I became weak too. I have to look after my health as well as keeping my wife healthy. So, I left think-ing of going on voyages again.”</p>
    <p>You might have understood by this time that all my wealth did not came as a gift from anybody. It came to me because of my daring deeds and facing many troubles” said Sindbad, the sailor. He thanked the porter fpr patiently hearing his story. He took him inside thepalace, and dined with him. His wife too treated the porter very kindly. The couple gare porter Sindbad valuable clothes, gold- coins, packets of dried fruits and jars of grape-juice as gift and sent him off respectfully.</p>
