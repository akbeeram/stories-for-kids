    <p>In the town of Baghdad, there lived a labourer named Sindbad. He used to carry bags and other things and earn money for his livelihood. So people used to call him porter Sindbad.</p>
    <p>On one midday, in summer, he was going along the street carrying a heavy load. Sweat was flowing down from his body. He felt thirsty and hungry and be-came weak.</p>
    <p>He approached a spacious building on the road-side. There were many trees both inside and outside of the building. ? There were stone-benches in the shade of trees. He went to a bench and sat there taking rest. He thanked the man who pro-vided the benches there. He looked in-side through the gate.</p>
    <p>A man, perhaps the owner of that build-ing sat in a cushion chair. Two slaves were there with fans on either side of him. One lady was peeling and giving the fruits to him. Two beautiful ladies were singing and dancing before him.</p>
    <p>The	porter enquired a gateman about the owner of that building. He said that it was the very poor but he is very rich. What was the sin I have done and what was the good he had done?” He uttered the words unexpected-ly aloud. When he was about to go; the gatemen came to him and said “Sir, my master is calling you. Please follow us”.</p>
    <p>The poor man said fearfully “I only hated my poverty, but I didn’t say even a word regarding your master.” But they ntcared his arguement and took him to master.</p>
    <p>“Hallo! Sir! Please come and sit here.”He showed him a seat beside him and again asked him” May I know your name please?”</p>
    <p>“My name is porter Sindbad”</p>
    <p>“Very fine! my name is Sindbad too, I am a sailor.”</p>
    <p>Again the master said “a little time ago, you have scolded the God for creating you as a poor man. But if you hear all my troubles and tests I underwent, you cer-tainly feel happy for your birth. He then offered the porter some fruits and grapejuice. While the porter was taking them, the master sejp again” I have made seven voyages on sea, and each time faced death nearly. My friends lost their lives in the voyages and are now taking rest in their tombs. As, I am lucky, I could survie. Time came and there is need to tell you my story. Do you like to hear it?”</p>
    <p>Oh! Sure Sir!" said the porter.</p>
    <p>Generally, everyone likes stories. These stories are not fairy-tales, but hap-pened naturally in the voyages. So, they will be more interesting. The seven voy-ages were told as seven stories to the porter Sindbad by Sindbad, the sailor.</p>
