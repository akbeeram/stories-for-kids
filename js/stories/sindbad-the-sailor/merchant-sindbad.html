    <p>Sindbad, the sailor told his story and Sindbad, the porter heard it. There could be some difficulty in telling a story. But there wouldn’t be any difficulty in hearing a story. Just for hearing the story, he was getting good remuneration-good food and great presents. In general people say sto-ries from epics and legendaries or enact plays and collect money from the audi-ence. But this was quite contrary to that. Perhaps there would be no one on earth like him to receive great honours, just for hearing the story.</p>
    <p>The porter took all the presents home happily. He wrapped the gold coins in some rags and kept them in his wallet around his waist. For some days, He to open the wallet and see the coins, daily, at least once. Sindbad, the sailor’s daring adventures did not leave his memory. Though now he (the porter) was rich enough and need not search for his daily food, he was feeling it difficult sitting idle home. No burden was there far him-no children and no relatives. There would be no loss in trying to get a job or an engagement. When an old man like the sailor was still trying to do business, why, he, an young man, should sit idle at home? So, he decided to do some business, livinc But, how could he, a porter, have the chances of going abroad for business? Finally, he decided to leave Baghdad and 9° t0 another place for doing some busi- there.lf he earns much profits there, he could return to Baghdad then. He collected and packed all his belong- ings in a gunny bag. The gold-coins were belt. He started at mid¬night and left the towrj. He had no desti-nation in mind, so he was walking along narrow path. It lead him to a forest full of trees and hills. Birds were singing gaily and now and then some animals were yell-ing.</p>
    <p>It was the first time for him to see the forest, hence, he was looking surprisingly at the colourful birds and the small ani-mals there. A herd of deer passed by from his side. Great clouds spread over the for-est and he saw the peacocks dancing. Soon, it began to rain heavily. He ran to a big tree and stood under its shade. He wiped his face and hang the bag to a branch. Just then, he saw a hyena com-ing towards him. He shook with fear-the fearful animal may jump at him and suck his blood. At once he climbed up the tree and sat between the branches. Many other animals flocked under the tree. The hy-ena might have fled seeing the other ani-mals-it was not there. He never knew that a forest was near his town.</p>
    <p>Up to the morning, every now and then, he' heard the fearful laugh of the , hpna.Slowly the other animals vacated the / place and went away. He got down from the tree and began walking fast. At last, he reached a small town. The surroundings as well as the people seemed to be nice to him. So he decided to stay there for doing his business.</p>
    <p>He sold two gold-coins and with that money he took a house for rent and be-gan doing his business. Very soon he be-came rich and purchased a large house. A rich man of that place, gave his daughter in marriage to him. Now, he became famous as merchant-Sindbad. Years were passing and his family too grew with children. So he never thought of going back to Baghdad again. He stayed there till the end of his time.</p>
