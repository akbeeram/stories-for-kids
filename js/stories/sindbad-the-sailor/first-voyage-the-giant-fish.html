    <p>“My father was a rich merchant. By the time of his death, he amassed a great wealth. After his death no one was there to guide me properly. I spent a lot of money for my pleasures. Lands too were sold. A scanty little amount was left behind. Then came an idea-to do business with that amount. Business in those days was lim-ited to voyage only.</p>
    <p>I Purchased some merchandise and started on a ship from Basora port of Baghdad. The ship used to sail on the sea with the help of wind and man¬power only. We went on selling our goods and buying new goods at various ports. A few days later, our ship reached an island. The is-land was very beautiful with grass and small bushes. We got down on it and were cooking food. Soon the island began to move. Our captain was shouting “Come up at once. It’s not an island but a great fish! you made a fire on it and that made it wake up from its sleep. Come soon, or it will take you down into the water!”</p>
    <p>On hearing his warning some people could get on to the ship. I and two of my friends were left behind. The fish began drowning with us. We were almost drowned to head-length. I. know a little swimming and hence jumped into the sea and began swimming. By luck, I could catch a beam of wood and began to float on the water with it. It took me far away from the ship. Tide after tide I hit the beam and pushed it farward. At last it took me to an island. Soon after reaching there, I swam to the shore and fell fast asleep due to weariness.</p>
    <p>When I opened my eyes, I found bright sunlight all around. It seemed to be a de-serted island. No man was there. My legs were swollen and eyes were causing inflamation. So; slowly I crawled on the fours and reached a water-pool. The trees near by were full of fruits. As it was the only food available there, I drank the wa-ter and ate the fruits. After gaining some strength, I began to wander in the island. I saw a nice horse and went near to catch it. Suddenly a man appeared before me and asked “Who are you and how didyou come here?” I told him all about the voy-age and my reaching there with the log of wood. He gave me some food and said “I am the horse trainer of the king Mirzan. come with me to the king, he will certainly help you.” So saying he gave me a horse and took me to the king.Hearing my story the king treated me kindly. He appointed me as a supervisor of the port there. I spent there, months together awaiting to see at ,east one ship from Baghdad. One day, I found a big vessel coming to the shore. When I went near the ship, the captain came running to me and embraced me with great pleasure. They thought that I might have drowned in the sea and lost for ever. So he said “All your goods are safe and we are happy to see you again.” Later, I told him ail about my reaching there.</p>
    <p>I presented some costlier and rare ar-ticles to the king and requested his per-mission to leave the country. The king was greatly annoyed with my request; but he didn’t object me. He gave me valuable presents and sent me off.</p>
    <p>After a few days’ travel, our ship reached Basora port of Baghdad. My joy knew no bounds. My friends came to the port and welcomed me with great pleasure. The king’s presents were great in value. They helped me to construct a beautiful house at Baghdad. I began leading a pleasant life with the profits of the trade.</p>
    <p>Dear friend! you have heard the story of my first voyage. If you come tomorrow, I will tell you about my second voyage. Please take a little more wine and take these gold coins as a present.”</p>
