    <p>T here was a Shiva temple in a big city in the south. A hermit named Tamrachurna lived in that temple. He eked out his living by begging alms. He kept the extra foodgrains in a vessel and hung it up on a nail on the wall. This extra good grains he distributed amongst the workers of the temple.</p>
    <p>A mouse named Hiranyak also lived in a burrow in the temple compound with his family members. One day his family members told him,” This sanyasi sleeps with the vessel hung up on the wall. It is difficult for us to reach it. You are strong and powerful. Why not try to reach the vessel? Then we will not have to run hither and thither for food.” The mouse tried to reach the vessel and was successful in jumping into it. He then had his fill and threw the remainder to his family. This became a nightly routine. The hermit tried his best to save the foodgrains but the mouse managed to get at it.</p>
    <p>One day the hermit found a way to scare the mouse. He brought a splintered bamboo and would strike it against the vessel. Being afraid of getting hurt the mouse kept away from the vessel and wait for an opportunity to get at the foodgrains. Many times the tussle between them went on for the whole night.</p>
    <p>One day another sadhu, a friend of Tamrachurna, arrived at the temple. He had returned from a pilgrimage. Tamrachurna received him warmly. After dinner they lay down on matresses and started talking on matters of religion and morality. Tamrachurna’s mind was on the vessel containing food and in between the talks he struck the bamboo at the vessel to keep the mouse off it. The other hermit whose name was Brihatsifak got annoyed at the attitude of his host. He thought that Tamrachurna was ignoring him.</p>
    <p>He told Tamrachurna in an angry tone, “Tamrachurna, here I am talking to you but you are swinging that bamboo. I think I am not welcome here and should go elsewhere. It is written in the holy books that one should not stay at a place where one gets no importance or is ignored. It is said that one should leave even one's own father’s house where there is someone who is shor tempered, jealous, arrogant, ignorant or foul mouthed.”</p>
    <p>Tamrachurna replied politely, “Friend, a man in distress sometimes behaves contrary to his nature, I am not ignoring you. \ mouselias made my life miserable. I am shaking the bamboo to scare him away. He then related that in spite of all his efforts the mouse is able to jump high and get at the foodgrains. It seems that this mouse possesses some extraordinary powers.</p>
    <p>Brithatsfak pondered for a while and said, “I feel this mouse has his burrow over some buried treasure. It is because of this that he is able to jump to such heights. You know, wealth intoxicates a lot. Even a mule starts behaving like a thorough bred horse under its influence.”</p>
    <p>Next day, both the hermits found out its burrow with the help of the footprints of the mouse. Then they went there with an axe and spade and dug out the place. They not only got hold of the stored foodgrains in the underground burrow but also laid hands on the buried treasure. In the process, good many mice got killed or injured.</p>
    <p>Next day, when Hiranyak went to the temple, Tamrachurna again started banging the bamboo on the vessel. His friend told him not to do it any more. He said, “We have deprived the mouse of the strength. He will never be able to reach your foodgrains. You can sleep without any worry.</p>
    <p>The mouse tried to jump into the vessel but failed. He tried his best but could not reach even half the height. It was only the heat of the wealth that enabled him to jump so high. Now he was helpless and his morale was shattered. His family and other dependents started ridiculing him instead of sympathising with his plight. They started leaving him one by one as he was unable to provide them food. Hiranyak wras crestfallen at their selfishness ' and thought of leaving the place and eventually accompanied Laghupatnak to another place.</p>
