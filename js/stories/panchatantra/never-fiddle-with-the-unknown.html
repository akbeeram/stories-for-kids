    <p>A businessman was having a temple constructed near his city.
    Lot of workers were engaged in the task doing different works. This story relates to the period when carpenters had been engaged for wood work. A big Arjuna tree was being sawn into planks. The workers used to go to the nearby city for lunch. That day, they all left to have their lunch. The carpenter had left a half sawn plank and had inserted a big wooden nail so that the two parts remained apart and the remaining part of the plank could be sawn easily when he resumed work.

    <p>A group of monkeys came there and started swinging on the trees. One of them sat on the plank. Monkeys by nature are playful. The monkey saw the wooden nail in the plank. For sometime, he looked curiously at it. Then he playfully tried to pull it out. He did not succeed at first and started pulling at it vigorously. The foolish monkey had no idea that this testicles were between the two sawn parts. As he pulled out the nail the two parts of the plank came together and his testicles were crushed between them. He screamed loudly and died instantaneously. The foolish monkey tried to fiddle with things that were beyond his comprehension and without thinking of the consequences. Anyone who does things like that is bound to meet with the same fate as that monkey.</p>
