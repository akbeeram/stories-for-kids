    <p>There was a city called Mahilaropya in some district of the southern peninsula. A little away from this city was a huge banyan tree which gave shelter to a lot of birds of all kinds. A crow, named Laghupatnak also lived on that tree. One day he set out in search of food. He saw a hunter coming towards the banyan tree with a strong net and a bag of rice. The crow became anxious about the safety of the innumerable residents of the tree and came back. He cautioned all the birds not to fall prey to greed and get down to eat the rice. As expected the hunter laid his net under the tree and sprinkled grains of rice all over it. He then hid himself behind a bush waiting for the birds to get down to eat the rice.</p>
    <p>The feathered community of the tree did not get down as they had been warned about their entrapment. A group of pigeons led by their chief Chitragreev passed that way. Though Laghupatnak warned them about the hunter, being very hungry, they ignored his advice. More than fifty pigeons including their leader Chitragreev were entrapped in the net. The hunter was elated to find so many birds in his net. The pigeons were panicky and did not know what to do. Their chief Chitragreev addressed them, “Friends, it_is of no use to rue now. Whatever had to happen has come about. Now we have to act unitedly to get over the problem. It is said that if a person does not lose his cool when SesetTwith problems will eventually surmount them. Let us all fly away with the net and then we will think about how to get out of it.”</p>
    <p>As the hunter approached them, the pigeons flew away with the net with all their combined strength. The hunter was aghast and chased them for some time. He thought that as the pigeons would get tired they would come down. But soon he lost sight of them. Laghupatnak followed the pigeons as he was curious to find as to how they would free themselves from the net.</p>
    <p>When Chitragreev saw that the hunter was nowhere in sight, he asked the pigeons to fly towards north-east of the city where his friend Hiranyak, thp mouse, lived in his fortified burrows. They got down at the called out for his friend. Recognising the voice of his friend, Hiranyak came out and expressed surprise at the plight of his friend and his followers. Chitragreev narrated the entire story and said, “We are in trouble because of our greed. It is well known that greed diverts one of prudence. Now please cut this net and free us of this bondage.” Hiranyak wanted to free his friend first. Chitragreev protested and requested him to free his followers first. He said, “They are my dependents. It is my duty to look after them. A leader should care for his loyal followers before he thinks of himself. A leader who cares more for his followers earns their eternal loyalty.” Hiranyak took no time in cutting the net with his sharp teeth. Soon Chitragreev flew away with his horde.</p>
    <p>Laghupatnak saw and heard all the talks between Chitragreev and Hiranyak. He was very impressed. He thought that it was difficult to come across such true friends. I would be lucky if I can find such friends. He went to the door of the burrow and called for Hiranyak. Hiranyak did not come out and asked from inside his fort what he wanted. The crow replied, “I am Laghupatnak. I want to be your friend.” Hiranyak countered, “This is against the law of nature. I am your natural prey. How can we be friends? Please go away from here.”</p>
    <p>Laghupatnak made another effort. He said, “It is not necessary that every creature should act according to his natural inclination and instincts. There can be exceptions. I have been immensely impressed by what I saw and heard just now. Please honour me with your friendship.” Hiranyak replied, “Inborn tendencies„are^ hard to shed. Fire can never be cool. If one develops enmity due to some temporary cause, it can be ended. Ours is natural and inborn enmity that cannot be wished away. How can I trust you?” The crow suggested that he remained inside his burrow and even then they could be friends. The mouse thought for a while and said, “You will remain outside and I can talk to you from inside my hole.” Laghupatnak agreed and they started exchanging their views from their respective positions. Laghupatnak also started bringing food for his friend.</p>
    <p>Gradually they became fast to come out and sit under the wings of the crow. One day Laghupatnak seemed to be in a sad mood as he came to see his friend. Hiranyak enquired about the cause of his feeling of misery. Laghupatnak told him that he was leaving the place. Hiranyak was dumb struck. He had become so fond of the crow that he could not think of life without his leaving that forest. He said, “The ruler of this place is lazy and a debauch. He is only interested in adding on to his harem. The learned and good people are leaving this kingdom. The ruler is surrounded by sycophants and the whole social system has collapsed. Even the nature is offended and the crops are failing. People are hungry and are killing birds for food. Life is so insecure. It is no use living in such a place.”</p>
    <p>“Where do you intend going? Hiranyak enquired. Laghupatnak said, “There is a huge pond towards south of this city. My friend Mantharak lives there. He will help me in finding food.” The mouse then expressed his desire to go with him. Hiranyak said that he was also disenchanted with that place. And that would tell him the reasons later. Laghupatnak accepted this proposal. He asked the mouse to sit on his back and he flew in the direction of the pond, which they reached in a few days.</p>
    <p>Mantharak, the tortoise, did not recognise his friend at first glance. He dived into the pond. Laghupatnak asked the mouse to alight and called out for his friend. Mantharak came out and greeted his friend warmly. Hiranyak came forward and was introduced to Mantharak. Laghupatnak praised Hiranyak and told Mantharak about his innumerable qualities of head and heart. He also disclosed that due to some reasons he got sick of his people and place and desired to live with them. Mantharak asked him the reason and Hiranyak related his tale of woes</p>
    <p>Mantharak sympathised with him and said, “Friend, this_ world is a cruel place. How can you expect sacrifice, affection and jove in this selfish world? You cannot find anybody who has not been treated like you. Do not grieve over the past. You are welcome to live with us.” The three friends started living together.</p>
    <p>One day, as they sat talking, a deer arrived. He seemed to be scared of something and was looking back over his shoulders. Laghupatnak accosted him and asked the reason for his nervousness. The deer answered, “Is there any place where I can hide? A hunter is after me.” Laghupatnak looked around and said, “You need not fear anymore. The hunter is nowhere in sight.” The deer told them that he has got separated from his herd. Laghupatnak invited him to stay with them. Chitrang, the deer, gratefully accepted the invitation. The four became inseparable and their days passed in one another’s company.</p>
    <p>Sometime later, a jackal named Lubdhak also arrived there. As he saw Chitrang, he thought the meat of this well built dear would be so delicious. He realised that he could not kill him and would have to plot his liquidation. He started talking to Chitrang very sweetly and requested the foursome to include him in their circle. At this Mantharak said, “You are a meat eating animal. Then your wily nature and ways are well known. We doubt if it will be wise to have you as a friend.” Lubdhak countered that if the crow can be your friend why do you object to me. Mantharak asked, “Can fire and water, gods and demons, mongoose and snake be ever friends?”</p>
    <p>The deer intervened and said, “Why argue about it? He only wants to be our friend. Let him be.” But Hiranyak remained unconvinced and opined, “The fellow will destroy you by posing as a friend. Let hime be". But Hiranyak remained unconvinced and opined, "The fellow will destroy you by posing as friend. We will have to be careful about him."Lubdhak was a cunning character. He gradually won their confidence. One day, he led Chitrang to a place where a hunter had laid a trap to ensure some prey. The deer got entangled. He asked Lubdhak, to cut the net and set him free. The jackal had other ideas. He saw the chance of savouring the meat of the deer. He came out with some excuse and said that he will do so in the morning. He thought that the hunter would kill the dear and skin him. He would then have the chance of eating some juicy meat with the bones. Chitrang realised that Lubdhak had tricked him and he was sure to die at the hands of the hunter. He rued the fact that he did not listen to his true friends and trusted this hypocrite and untrustworthy jackal. It was he who silenced his friends and forced them to allow this crafty jackal to stay with them.</p>
    <p>As Chitrang did not return for a long time, the crow, the mouse and the tortoise grew anxious. They asked Laghupatnak to locate their friend. Laghupatnak found him entangled in the net and took Chitragreev and Mantharak to the site. They told Chitrang not to worry as they would leave no stone unturned to save him. Hiranyak unfolded the plan of his rescue. He said, “As soon as you see the hunter approaching extend your stomach and hold your breath. Pretend that you are dead. The crow will sit on your head and peck at your eyes. I shall cut the net. The hunter would think that you are dead. At that time Mantharak would appear. The hunter would run alter him to catch him. You speed away as soon as Laghupatnak gives you the signal.</p>
    <p>As the hunter ran after the tortoise to catch him, Chitrang stood up and was gone in a few leaps. The hunter threw his stout staff at the deer which hit the jackal hiding in a bush. Mantharak quietly plunged into the pond. The jackal died there and then. The hunter went away greatly disappointed and the four friends returned to their abode. It is true that sincere friends are rare. The mean pose as friends and get you into trouble while a true friend will help you even at the cost of his life.</p>
