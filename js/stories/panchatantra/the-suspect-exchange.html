    <p>A brahmin couple lived in a village. They were extremely poor.</p>
    <p>It was with great difficulty that the brahmin was able to keep his body and soul together. His wife was always taunting him for his poverty. She grumbled that they never had two square meals a day. She said, “Since marriage, I have never known any comforts. I never had any jewellery or good clothes/’ The brahmin replied that it was enough that they could eat. He advised her to be content with her situation.</p>
    <p>As they were arguing in this way, a sadhu arrived at their house and asked for some food. The brahmin told his wife, “I am going to another village for alms. It is makar sankranti. You feed this sadhu. The wife realised that there w7as no food in the house that she could offer to the guest. Then she remembered that there were some sesame seeds. She cleaned them and pounded them and spread them to dry. Misfortunes never come alone. As luck would have it, a dog came and pissed on the spread- out sesame seeds.</p>
    <p>The woman felt miserable. She could not feed the guest with the soiled seeds. She hit upon a plan. She took the seeds in a basket and made rounds of the city calling, “Exchange cleaned and pounded sesame seeds with equal weight of uncleaned seeds.” Hearing this, a housewife thought that it was a good bargain. She would be saved the trouble of cleaning and pounding. She came out and invited the brahmin woman inside the house. At the time her son came out and said, “Mother, do not do it. Only a mad person wTould exchange her cleaned sesame seeds with uncleaned ones. There must be some snag in it. Nobody gives good quality things for bad quality ones.” The mother accepted the advice and wrent into the house.</p>
