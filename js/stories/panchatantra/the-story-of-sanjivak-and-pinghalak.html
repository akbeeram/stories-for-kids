    <p>A businessman named Vardhman lived in the city of Mahilaropya in the southern region. He had earned a lot of money but still desired to earn more. He decided to go to Mathura for this purpose. He told his wife of his plans. She opposed it saying, "You have plenty of money and wealth. I see no wisdom in counting unforeseen troubles in a foreign place." Vardhman countered her argument and said, " In this world, money is all powerful. If you do not go on adding to your assets, they may be depleted. The common people  look upon a moneyed man as wise  and learned.  Nothing is unattainable for a wealthy person. A poor man furthermore, commands no respect in society. Even parents do  not bother about a poor son."</p>
    <p>Vardhman decided on the items he would deal in at Mathura. They were loaded on bullock carts. His favourite bullocks-Sanjivak and Nandanâ€”were yoked to his personal cart. He loved these bulls as his sons as they were born in his house. After making all arrangements, this caravan of bullock carts started on its journey to Mathura which was, at that time, a renowned centre of trade and commerce.</p>
    <p>After travelling for many days, Vardhman's caravan reached the outskirts of Mathura. Unfortunately his cart got stuck in, the marshy land on the bank of river Yamuna. The bullocks tried their best to pull out the cart but could not. In the efforts, Sanjivak broke his leg. Vardhman tried his best to free and bring out his favourite bullock but failed. He kept on trying for three days but Sanjivak could. not be brought out. The servants were getting restive. They told Vardhman that there was danger of their falling prey to dacoits or wild animals if they stayed longer at that place. Eventually they prevailed on Vardhman to leave Sanjivak to his fate and proceed to Mathura. Vardhman reluctantly agreed to their suggestion and left two men to look after Sanjivak. They both abandoned Sanjivak and joined their master at Mathura. They concocted a story that the bull died of his injuries and they cremated him on the spot. Vardhman grieved for Sanjivak but accepted it as the will of God.</p>
