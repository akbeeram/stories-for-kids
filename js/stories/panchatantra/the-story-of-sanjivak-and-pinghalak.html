    <p>A businessman named Vardhman lived in the city of Mahilaropya in the southern region. He had earned a lot of money but still desired to earn more. He decided to go to Mathura for this purpose. He told his wife of his plans. She opposed it saying, "You have plenty of money and wealth. I see no wisdom in counting unforeseen troubles in a foreign place." Vardhman countered her argument and said, " In this world, money is all powerful. If you do not go on adding to your assets, they may be depleted. The common people  look upon a moneyed man as wise  and learned.  Nothing is unattainable for a wealthy person. A poor man furthermore, commands no respect in society. Even parents do  not bother about a poor son."</p>
    <p>Vardhman decided on the items he would deal in at Mathura. They were loaded on bullock carts. His favourite bullocks-Sanjivak and Nandan—were yoked to his personal cart. He loved these bulls as his sons as they were born in his house. After making all arrangements, this caravan of bullock carts started on its journey to Mathura which was, at that time, a renowned centre of trade and commerce.</p>
    <p>After travelling for many days, Vardhman's caravan reached the outskirts of Mathura. Unfortunately his cart got stuck in, the marshy land on the bank of river Yamuna. The bullocks tried their best to pull out the cart but could not. In the efforts, Sanjivak broke his leg. Vardhman tried his best to free and bring out his favourite bullock but failed. He kept on trying for three days but Sanjivak could. not be brought out. The servants were getting restive. They told Vardhman that there was danger of their falling prey to dacoits or wild animals if they stayed longer at that place. Eventually they prevailed on Vardhman to leave Sanjivak to his fate and proceed to Mathura. Vardhman reluctantly agreed to their suggestion and left two men to look after Sanjivak. They both abandoned Sanjivak and joined their master at Mathura. They concocted a story that the bull died of his injuries and they cremated him on the spot. Vardhman grieved for Sanjivak but accepted it as the will of God.</p>
    <p>Sanjivak was sad at being left to his fate like that. He thought to himself, “It is true that, in times of adversity, even your own shadow abandons you. I have^ served my master loyally all these years and wherTJ needed his support he abandoned mel Iiythis world you become dispensable if you have no utilit^^alueT/He decided to make all efforts to free himself. At iirstThe did not succeed but eventually was able to come out of the swamp. It did not take him long to regain his strength as he had full run of the place. He grazed on the soft and green grass of the river bank and soon became very strong, so much so that when he bellowed, it echoed in the entire forest and could frighten the bravest.</p>
    <p>One day, Pingalak, a lion came to the river bank to quench his thirst with his attendants. As he heard the roar of Sanjivak, he thought that some very powerful animal was living on the river bank. He got so frightened that he left the place with his courtiers and even thought of leaving that forest for safety. Two jackals named Karkat and Damanak, who had sometime back worked as ministers of the lion Pingalak, saw all this from a distance. They had been dismissed for corruption but still followed Pingalak in the hope of getting restored to their former position. They started talking to each other about what they had seen.</p>
    <p>Damanak said, “Our king seems to be scared of something.”</p>
    <p>“How can you say that?” his brother Karkat querried.</p>
    <p>“Did you not see him running away without drinking at the river? It was quite evident from his face and eyes. We must find out the reason, ” Damanak said.</p>
    <p>Karkat advised him not to poke his nose in something that did not concern him. He may get into trouble>Damanak was adamant. He thought that it may provide them both in opportunity to retrieve their lost status. He decided to investijite the cause of Pingalak’s behaviour. Damanak approached Hngalak and greeted him. Pingalak said, “How are you DamanakV Seeing you after a long time.’ “Sir, I am still your loyal servant.'Spur welfare is uppermost in my mind. Just now, I have come t^talk about j something that I would like to discuss with you in private.”</p>
    <p>Damanak got closer as everyone left. “Your majesty seems to be worried about something. If you confide in me, may be I can help you. Believe me, I will not hesitate to even lay down my life for you.” Pingalak told him his fears about some ferocious animal living in that forest and that he was thinking of migrating elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Damanak immediately guessed that Pingalak was terrified. He said, “My lord, one should not give up one’s rights without fighting for them. It does not behove a king to run away like this. If you so desire I can find out who that animal is that has scared you to this extent.</p>
    <p>Pingalak was duly impressed and asked him to investigate. He also assured Damanak that he still had great affection for him. Bidding good bye Damanak left for the swamp of Yamuna. He hid himself behind a thick bush to have a look at the animal that had frightened Pingalak. Soon he espied Sanjivak roaming about. For the other wild animals of the forest a bullock may be a strange thing, but Damanak had seen many of these grass eating domestic animals in villages. He thought it prudent not to disclose the identity of the animal to Pingalak so he remained scared of him.</p>
    <p>He returned to Pingalak and informed him that not only did he see the ferocious animal but he even talked to that ferocious animal that was stalking the river bank. He further told that the powerful animal was under protection of God Shankar himself. Pingalak felt the ground slipping from under his feet as he heard this. But Damanak assured him, uYou need not fear him. Though I am a weak person, my lord, I am gifted with an excellent If you desire I can produce him before you.</p>
    <p>“If you do that, I shall restore you to a prime position amongst my ministers,” Paingalak gratefully assured him. Damana , a wi y person, told him that he had no need for official position. lie was doing it, he said, as it was his duty to serve him as a loyal su jec .</p>
    <p>Damanak found Sanjivak lying in the sun contentedly chewing the cud. He boldly approached him and said, “You good for nothing bull, how dare you disturb the peace of the forest? Our king Pingalak is furious and has called you.” Sanjivak enquired about the identity of Pingalak. He was completely unnerved when told that Pingalak the lion was the ruler of that forest. He asked Damanak to intercede on his behalf and get him pardoned. Damanak pretended that it was not an easy task but as he seemed to be a gentle person he would try his best. He asked Sanjivak to follow him. As they reached the edge of the forest, he advised the bull to wait there so that he could go ahead and to assuage the anger of Pingalak.</p>
    <p>Then he went to Pingalak and informed him that Sanjivak is willing to come and be your friend if he is assured safety of his life. Pingalak was extremely pleased to hear this and asked Damanak to fetch the bull assuring him of his friendship and security of life. On hearing this Sanjivak felt relieved and grateful to Damanak and vowed eternal friendship with him. Damanak then took Sanjivak to the lion. Pingalak received him warmly and asked him to live fearlessly in the forest as he was not only an honoured guest but a brother.</p>
    <p>Damanak was appointed prime minister while his brother Karkat became a minister. Karkat acknowledged his brother as a master diplomat who had so cleverly got back his authority and position. Damanak said it was nothing. Now he would take steps to consolidate his power and have the king eating from his hands.</p>
    <p>The friendship between Pingalak and Sanjivak grew dav by day. Sanjivak had a deep knowledge of religious and moral principles that he ha^aimbibed by listening to the discourses of leai ned men at Vardhman’s place. They spent most of their time togethei and soon the lion started neglecting his .duties* Taking in any manner they pleased. There was total anarc y m kingdom. Karkat asked his brother to set things right, amana asked him to be patient as he now intended to sow the see s o discord between the lion and the bull and thus get rid of Sanjiva and further consolidate his position.</p>
    <p>He went to Pingalak and informed him that he had some bad news for him. He informed him that Sanjivak planned to kill him and become king. Pingalak was shocked to hear this. He could not imagine that one whom he treated as his brother would turn a traitor. Damanak told him not to grieve over his friend s treachery as, in this world, even a brother would not hesitate to stab him in the back for kingdom, position and wealth. He would see to it that no harm came to him.</p>
    <p>Damanak went straight to Sanjivak and informed him that Pingalak intended to kill him as he feared that he would one day dethrone him. As he was his friend he was forewarning him. Sanjivak regretted the day he agreed to be the lion's friend. He thought it was foolish of him to trust a wild and natural enemy. Water and fire can never co-exist. For a while, he thought of running away but then decided to face the situation boldly.</p>
    <p>Next day, when he went to the court of Pingalak, he found the lion in an angry mood looking at him with blood red eyes. Sanjivak also stared at him in an angry manner. Pingalak was convinced that Sanjivak wanted to kill him. He pounced on him and a fight ensued between them. Sanjivak fought bravely but eventually lay dead. Pingalak was also grievously injured. All the animals were also perplexed at the sudden turn of events. Karkat immediately guessed that it was all his brother’s doing. He took Damanak aside and chastised him for making two friends fight each other. Damanak replied, “A diplomat never bothers about the means to gain his objectives. If one is to think of morality how could one improve one’s status in life? The road to power is not paved with ideals and good conduct.” Karkat was furious and replied that he did not want to associate with such a foolish king and unscrupulous brother and left the place.</p>
    <p>On his part, Pingalak felt a tinge of remorse for killing his friend. He cast a last glance at Sanjivak's inert body and left to take some rest accompanied by wi</p>
