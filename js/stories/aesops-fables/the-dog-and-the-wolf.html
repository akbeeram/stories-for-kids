    <p>A gaunt Wolf was almost dead with hunger when he
        happened to meet a House-dog who was passing by. ‘Ah,
        Cousin,’ said the Dog. ‘I knew how it would be; your
        irregular life will soon be the ruin of you. Why do you
        not work steadily as I do, and get your food regularly
        given to you?’</p>
    <p>‘I would have no objection,’ said the Wolf, ‘if I could
        only get a place.’</p>
    <p>‘I will easily arrange that for you,’ said the Dog; ‘come
        with me to my master and you shall share my work.’</p>
    <p>So the Wolf and the Dog went towards the town
        together. On the way there the Wolf noticed that the hair
        on a certain part of the Dog’s neck was very much worn
        away, so he asked him how that had come about.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, it is nothing,’ said the Dog. ‘That is only the place
        where the collar is put on at night to keep me chained up;
        it chafes a bit, but one soon gets used to it.’</p>
    <p>‘Is that all?’ said the Wolf. ‘Then good-bye to you,
        Master Dog.’</p>
    <p>Better starve free than be a fat slave.</p>
