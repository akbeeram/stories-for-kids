    <p>It happened that a Fisher, after fishing all day, caught
        only a little fish. ‘Pray, let me go, master,’ said the Fish. ‘I
        am much too small for your eating just now. If you put
        me back into the river I shall soon grow, then you can
        make a fine meal off me.’</p>
    <p>‘Nay, nay, my little Fish,’ said the Fisher, ‘I have you
        now. I may not catch you hereafter.’</p>
    <p>A little thing in hand is worth more than a great thing
        in prospect.</p>
