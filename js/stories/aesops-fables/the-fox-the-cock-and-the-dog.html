    <p>One moonlight night a Fox was prowling about a
        farmer’s hen-coop, and saw a Cock roosting high up
        beyond his reach. ‘Good news, good news!’ he cried.</p>
    <p>‘Why, what is that?’ said the Cock.</p>
    <p>‘King Lion has declared a universal truce. No beast may
        hurt a bird henceforth, but all shall dwell together in
        brotherly friendship.’</p>
    <p>‘Why, that is good news,’ said the Cock; ‘and there I
        see some one coming, with whom we can share the good
        tidings.’ And so saying he craned his neck forward and
        looked afar off.</p>
    <p>‘What is it you see?’ said the Fox.</p>
    <p>‘It is only my master’s Dog that is coming towards us.
        What, going so soon?’ he continued, as the Fox began to
        turn away as soon as he had heard the news. ‘Will you not
        stop and congratulate the Dog on the reign of universal
        peace?’</p>
    <p>‘I would gladly do so,’ said the Fox, ‘but I fear he may
        not have heard of King Lion’s decree.’</p>
    <p>Cunning often outwits itself.</p>
