    <p>In a field one summer’s day a Grasshopper was hopping
        about, chirping and singing to its heart’s content. An Ant
        passed by, bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he
        was taking to the nest.</p>
    <p>‘Why not come and chat with me,’ said the
        Grasshopper, ‘instead of toiling and moiling in that way?’</p>
    <p>‘I am helping to lay up food for the winter,’ said the
        Ant, ‘and recommend you to do the same.’</p>
    <p>‘Why bother about winter?’ said the Grasshopper; we
        have got plenty of food at present.’ But the Ant went on
        its way and continued its toil. When the winter came the
        Grasshopper had no food and found itself dying of hunger,
        while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain
        from the stores they had collected in the summer. Then
        the Grasshopper knew:</p>
    <p>It is best to prepare for the days of necessity.</p>
