    <p>Akbar had a passion for hunting. One day Akbar was on his hunting trip, that he heard two owls quarelling very fiercely. Akbar asked Birbal, "Birbal, what are these owls saying? Why are they quarreling so loudly?</p>
    <p>Birbal said, "Both of them are settling the dowry amount, Huzoor. The first one who is groom s father, is saying that he wants to take 40 jungles in the dowry, with no animals at all. The other owl, who is bride's father is saying that he can arrange only 20 jungles at the moment.</p>
    <p>In the mean time, one owl hooted once more very loudly. Akbar asked Birbal, "Now what is he saying? Birbal said, "Now he is saying that if you wait for six months more, I can give you 40 jungles without animals.</p>
    <p>Akbar understood what Birbal wanted to say. He gave up hunting altogether.</p>
