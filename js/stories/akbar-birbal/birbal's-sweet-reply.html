    <p>One day the Emperor Akbar startled his courtiers with a strange question.</p>
    <p>"If somebody pulled my moustache what sort of punishment should be given to him?", he asked.</p>
    <p>"He should be flogged!" said one courtier.</p>
    <p>"He should be hanged!" said another</p>
    <p>"He should be beheaded!" said a third.</p>
    <p>"And what about you, Birbal?" asked the Emperor. "What do you think would be the right thing to do if somebody pulled my moustache?"</p>
    <p>"He should be given sweets," said Birbal. "Sweets?" gasped the other courtiers.</p>
    <p>"Yes" said Birbal. "Sweets, because the only one who would dare pull His Majesty's moustache is his grandson."</p>
    <p>So pleased was the Emperor with the answer that he pulled off his ring and gave it to Birbal as a reward.</p>
