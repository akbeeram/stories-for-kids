    <p>One day Akbar was taking a walk in his Royal Garden with several courtiers. Many flowers were flowering at that time of season. A poet pointed towards a beautiful flower and said, "look Jehanpanah,	how beautiful flower that is ? No man can produce such a beautiful thing as this." Birbal was also there. He said, "I don't agree with this, sometimes man can make more beautiful things than this." Akbar said, "Oh no Birbal, you are talking nonsense. This flower is really very beautiful."</p>
    <p>After a few days, Birbal presented Akbar a very skilled craftsman from Agra. He presented a beautiful carved marbel bouquet of flowers. The Emperor was very happy to see it and gave him one thousand gold coins.</p>
    <p>Just then, a boy came and presented the Emperor a beautiful bouquet of real flowers. The Emperor was very happy to see it too, so he gave a silver coin to the boy. Birbal said, "So the carving was more beautiful than the real thing."</p>
    <p>Akbar understood that he has fallen in the hands of his witty minister once again.</p>
