    <p>The King of Iran had heard that Birbal was one of the wisest men in the East and desirous of meeting him sent him an invitation to visit his country.</p>
    <p>In due course, Birbal arrived in Iran.</p>
    <p>When he entered the palace, he was flabbergasted to find not one but six kings seated there. All looked alike. All were dressed in kingly robes. Who was Ihe real King?</p>
    <p>The very next moment he got his answer. Confidently, he approached the King and bowed to him.</p>
    <p>The King asked Birbal, "How did you identify me ?"</p>
    <p>Birbal smiled and explained, "The false kings were all looking at you, while you yourself looked straight ahead. Even in regal robes, the common people will always look to their King for support."</p>
    <p>Overjoyed, the King embraced Birbal and showered him with gifts.</p>
