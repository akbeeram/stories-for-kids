    <p>Once a woman came to Birbal for his help. She said that the King wanted to construct some building on the land where her house was. She did not want to leave that place because that place belonged to her ancestors. Birbal said he would try his best.</p>
    <p>Construction began. Now, one day, Birbal came to that site with King Akbar for inspection. He saw many gunny bags tying near the pile of mud. Birbal started filling the gunny bags with that mud. "Why are you doing this, Birbal?", asked the King. Birbal replied, "To earn merit for next life."</p>
    <p>Amused by this statement, Akbar also joined him. After Birbal had filled some bags, he requested Akbar to lift one of the gunny bags filled with mud. "Oh, it is very heavy." Akbar said lifting one bag. Birbal said, "Think Huzoor, when only one bag is so heavy, how much mud will weigh in this piece of land. Will it not weigh heavily on your conscience?"</p>
