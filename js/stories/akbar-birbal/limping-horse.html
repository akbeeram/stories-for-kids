    <p>A nobleman's prized horse began to limp for no apparent reason.</p>
    <p>Veterinarians who were called found nothing wrong with the leg - no fracture, no sprain and no soreness - and they were baffled.</p>
    <p>The nobleman finally consulted Birbal.</p>
    <p>"Has anything changed for the horse in the last few months?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"I changed his trainer a few weeks ago," said the nobleman.</p>
    <p>"Does the horse get on well with his new trainer?"</p>
    <p>"Very well! In fact, he's devoted to him."</p>
    <p>"Does the trainer limp?"</p>
    <p>"Uh... yes, he does."</p>
    <p>"The reason for the horse's limp is clear," said Birbal. "He's imitating his handler. We all tend to imitate those whom we admire. The company we keep has a great influence on us."</p>
    <p>The nobleman put the horse in the charge of another trainer and the horse soon stopped limping.</p>
