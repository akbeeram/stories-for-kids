    <p>One day a man gave a jar to his neighbour to keep until he comes back from the pilgrimage. The jar had his life's earnings. After keeping it safely, the man left for the Pilgrimage. After six months when he returned from the Pilgrimage, he went to his neighbour and asked for his jar.</p>
    <p>The neighbour brought the jar and gave it to the man. The jtÂ»an opened the jar and found the mango pickle, instead of his money. He said to the neighbour politely, "Sir, I gave you the money to you in this jar, now it contains pickle. The neighbour said, "I don t know anything about your money. Whatever you gave to me I kept it, and only now I am bringing it out to give it to you."</p>
    <p>The man got very sad and went to Birbal for justice. Birbal asked the neighbour, "Where is the money which was kept in this jar. The neighbour said. "I have alread told that I do not know anything about the money kept in this jar. I didn't open it before, I didn't open it now. I just tool it and kept it as it was, and took it out as it was.</p>
    <p>Then Birbal called some women from the Royal kitchen and asked them, "How old this pickle is?" They said it is definitely not six months old. It is very new, maybe a month old only."</p>
    <p>Now the neighbour got caught. He returned all the money he took out from the jar.</p>
