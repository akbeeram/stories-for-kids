    <p>Once Akbar and Birbal were going around the town in disguise. They heard a woman scolding at her husband very loudly.</p>
    <p>"You fool," she was saying, "you good for nothing, Go away and don't come back till you've done the work."</p>
    <p>Akbar was surprised why such a strong man had obeyed his wife's commands so weakly.</p>
    <p>Birbal replied, "In every marriage, it's the wife who orders the husband around."</p>
    <p>But Akbar was not convinced. So he decided to conduct an experiment.</p>
    <p>The next day he summoned all the married men of Agra and announced to the gathering, "I would like to know how many men gathered here obey their wives' command. So, those who do, please go to the right and those who don't, go to your left."</p>
    <p>All except one man moved towards the right. Akbar was happy with this one man who did not obey his wife. He wanted to reward him.</p>
    <p>But Birbal interrupted the King and said, "Jahanpanah, I would like to ask this man a question before you reward him."</p>
    <p>The King gave his consent for this.</p>
    <p>Birbal then asked the man, "Tell me, sir. Why did you move to the left?"</p>
    <p>The man replied, "Well sir, my wife has told me to keep away from'the crowds. So when everyone moved to the right, I moved to the left."</p>
    <p>The Emperor was taken back to hear this. The entire gathering roared with laughter.</p>
