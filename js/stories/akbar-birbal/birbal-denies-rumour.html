    <p>One day a man stopped Birbal in the street and began narrating his woes to him.</p>
    <p>"I've walked twenty miles to see you/' he told Birbal finally, "and all along the way, people kept saying you were the most generous man in the country.</p>
    <p>Birbal knew the man was going to ask him for money.</p>
    <p>"Are you going back the same way? he asked.</p>
    <p>"Yes," said the man.</p>
    <p>"Will you do me a favour?"</p>
    <p>"Certainly," said the man. "What do you want me to do?"</p>
    <p>"Please deny the rumour of my generosity," said Birbal, walking away.</p>
