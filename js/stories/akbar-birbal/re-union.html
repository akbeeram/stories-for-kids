    <p>One day, when Akbar and Birbal were in discussions, Birbal happened to pass a harmless comment about Akbar's sense of humour. But Emperor Akbar was in a foul mood and took great offense to this remark. He asked Birbal, his court-jester, friend and confidant, to not only leave the palace but also to leave the walls of the city of Agra. Birbal was terribly hurt at being banished.</p>
    <p>A couple of days later, Akbar began to miss his best friend. He regretted his earlier decision of banishing him from the courts. He just could not do without Birbal and so sent out a search party to look for him. But Birbal had left town without letting anybody know of his destination. The soldiers searched high and low but were unable to find him anywhere.</p>
    <p>Then one day a wise saint came to visit the palace accompanied by two of his disciples. The disciples claimed that their teacher was the wisest man to walk the earth. Since Akbar was missing Birbal terribly, he thought it would be a good idea to have a wise man that could keep him company. But he decided that he would first test the holy man's wisdom.</p>
    <p>The saint had bright sparkling eyes, a thick beard and long hair. The next day, when they came to visit the court, Akbar informed the holy man that since he was the wisest man on earth, he would like to test him. All his ministers ^ould put forward a question and if his answers were satisfactory, he would be made a minister. But if he could ......</p>
    <p>though other people seemed to think so. Nor was he eager to display his cleverness but as he enjoyed answering questions, he was ready for the test.</p>
    <p>One of the ministers, Raja Todarmal, began the round of questioning. He asked "Who is a man's best friend on earth?" To which the wise saint replied, "His own good sense". Next Faizi asked "Which was the most superior thing on earth?" "Knowledge", answered the saint. "Which is the deepest trench in the world?", asked Abdul Fazal. And the saint's answer was "a woman's heart". "What is that which cannot be regained after it is lost?" questioned another courtier and the reply he received was 'life'. "What is undying in music" asked the court musician Tansen. The wise saint replied that it was the "notes". And then he asked "Which is the sweetest and most melodious voice at night -time? And the answer he received was "the voice that prays to God."</p>
    <p>Maharaj Mansingh of Jaipur, who was a guest at the palace asked, "What travels more speedily than the wind?" the saint replied that it was "man's thought". He then asked, "Which was the sweetest thing on earth?" and the saint said that it was "a baby's smile".</p>
    <p>Emperor Akbar and all his courtiers were very impressed with his answers, but wanted to test the saint himself. Firstly he asked what were the necessary requirements to rule over a kingdom, for which he was answered 'cleverness'. Then he asked "What was the gravest enemy of a King". The saint replied that it was 'selfishness'. The Emperor was pleased and offered the saint a seat of honour and asked him whether he could perform any miracles. The saint said that he could manifest any person the King asked to.</p>
    <p>The king asked to meet his minister and best friend Birbal.
        The saint simply pulled off his artificial beard and hair much to the surprise of the other courtiers. Akbar was stunned and could not believe his eyes. He stepped dowi\ to embrace the saint because he was none other than
        Birbal.
    </p>
    <p>Akbar had tears in his eyes as he told Birbal that he had suspected it to be him and had therefore asked him whether he could perform miracles. He showered Birbal with many valuable gifts to show him how happy he was at his return.</p>
