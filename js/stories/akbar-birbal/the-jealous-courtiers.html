    <p>One day Emperor Akbar was inspecting the law and order situation in the kingdom. OPne of his ministers who was jealous of Raja Birbal, complained that the Emperor gave importance only to Bubal's suggestions and all the other ministers were ignored.</p>
    <p>Akbar wanted the minister to know how wise Birbal was. There was a marriage procession going on.</p>
    <p>The Emperor ordered the minister to enquire whose marriage it was. The minister found out and walked towards the Emperor wearing a proud expression on his face.</p>
    <p>Then the King called Birbal and asked him too to enquire whose marriage was going on. When Birbal returned, Akbar asked the minister "Where are the couple going?" The minister said that the King had only asked him to enquire whose marriage was going on.</p>
    <p>Then Akbar asked Birbal the same question. "O My Majesty! They are going to the city of Allahabad," replied Raja Birbal. Now the King turned towards the minister and said, "Now do you understand why Birbal is more important to me? It is not enough if you complete a task. You have to use your intelligence to do a little more work. The minister's face fell. He had learnt the importance of being Birbal, the hard way.</p>
