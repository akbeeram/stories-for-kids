    <p>A farmer and his neighbour once went to Emperor Akbar's court with a complaint.</p>
    <p>"Your Majesty, I bought a well from him," said the farmer pointing to his neighbour, and now he wants me to pay for the water."</p>
    <p>"That's right, your Majesty," said the neighbour. "I sold him the well but not the water!"</p>
    <p>The Emperor asked Birbal to settle the dispute.</p>
    <p>"Didn't you say that you sold your well to this farmer?" Birbal asked the neighbour. "So, the well belongs to him now, but you have kept your water in his well. Is that right? Well, in that case you will have to pay him a rent or take your water out at once."</p>
    <p>The neighbour realized that he was outwitted. He quickly apologized and gave up his claim.</p>
