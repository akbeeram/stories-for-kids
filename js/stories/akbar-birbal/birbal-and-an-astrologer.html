    <p>Once the King Akbar heard that an astrologer in his kingdom was famous for his accurate predictions. He called him for a test. When he came to the Court, Akbar asked him, "I have heard that you predict very accurately so tell me when will you die?"</p>
    <p>The astrologer said he will have to make lots of calculations to predict it correctly. The King gave him one hour time to do so. The astrologer went to Birbal. Birbal gave him advice as what he should say to the King.</p>
    <p>The astrologer returned to the Court and said, "Huzoor I would die soon after you."</p>
    <p>Akbar understood very well that he was bluffing, but he did not want to take any chance, so he let him go. Thus Birbal saved the astrologer's life.</p>
