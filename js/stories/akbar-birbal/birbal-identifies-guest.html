    <p>"They are not guests," said the man, "They are my employees, all except one man. He is the only other guest. Can you tell me which of them is my other guest?" he asked. "May be I could," said Birbal, "Tell them a joke or something and I will observe them."</p>
    <p>The man told a joke that Birbal thought was perhaps the wofst he had heard in a long time. When he finished, everyone laughed uproariously.</p>
    <p>"Well," said the rich man. "I've told my joke. Now tell me who my other guest is."</p>
    <p>Birbal pointed out the man to him. "How did you know?" asked his host, amazed. "Employees tend to laugh at any joke told by their employers," explained Birbal.</p>
    <p>"When I saw that this man was the only one not laughing at your joke, and in fact, looked positively bored, I at once knew he was your other guest."</p>
