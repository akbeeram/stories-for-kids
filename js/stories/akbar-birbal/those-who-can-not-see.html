    <p>Emperor Akbar once had a census taken of the blind men in his empire.</p>
    <p>When the report arrived, he told Birbal, "It was easy to make this list because the blind in this empire are so few in number. The Begum would like to give alms to all of them."</p>
    <p>Birbal replied, "But, Jahanpanah, the blind are more in number than those who can see. Your men have forgotten to include those who have sight and yet cannot see."</p>
    <p>Akbar was angered to hear this and said, "Birbal, let's not have any more of your jokes."</p>
    <p>A few days later, the people in the city saw a curious sigj^ They saw Birbal in the city's main street, in broad daylijL' stringing a charpoy. Wondering what he was up to, they all gathered near him and asked what he was doing, 3^ Birbal would give no answer to them. Instead, he started dictating numbers to his assistants.</p>
    <p>"Start writing down." he said. "Number one, two, three, four."</p>
    <p>Every time a person asked Birbal what he was doing Birbal dictated a number to his assistant. Soon, Emperor Akbar passed by that way. He too was surprised by Birbal's activities and asked him, "Birbal, what are you doing?"</p>
    <p>As usual, without answering the Emperor, Birbal dictated a number to his assistant, "That will be two hundred and fifty."</p>
    <p>The Emperor was surprised to find his name included in the list, at the end.</p>
    <p>When asked, Birbal replied, "Today, two hundred and fifty men asked me what I was doing, though I was working in broad daylight. You were the last of those who asked me what I was doing Jahanpanah."</p>
    <p>The Emperor laughed, "Ha! Ha! Always a wag, this Birbal".</p>
