    <p>One day the Emperor asked Birbal, "Birbal, is it possible to be the both "noblest" and the "lowest" together?" Birbal said, "Yes, Jahaanpanaah" "Then bring me such a person."</p>
    <p>Birbal went and returned next day with a beggar and presenting him to Akbar said, "This is the lowest among all of your subjects, Jahaanpanaah". Akbar asked, "Good, that may be true, but I dont see that how he can be the noblest ?".</p>
    <p>"He has been given the honour of having an audience with the Emperor, that makes him the noblest among the beggars, Jahaanpanaah."</p>
