    <p>Birbal was famous not only in Akbar's kingdom but also in neighboring kingdoms too. Everyone was jealous of Akbar because he was having Birbal in his kingdom.</p>
    <p>Once Birbal was invited by Persian King. Parties were given in his honour. Birbal pleased people of Persian kingdom with his sense of humour. The King was very pleased with his performance, so many presents were heaped on him.</p>
    <p>Now it was the time of his departure for home, now someone who was jealousâ€ƒyou would compare the King of Persia to your King Akbar?"</p>
    <p>"Well!" Birbal replied, "Your King is a full moon," said Birbal. "Where as mine could be likened to the quarter moon."</p>
    <p>The Persians were very happy.</p>
    <p>But when Birbal got home people were angry on him. People who were jealous of him got a chance to defeat the Birbal. Akbar too was furious with him.</p>
    <p>"How could you belittle your own King!" a man said.</p>
    <p>"You are a conspirator!" Akbar said.</p>
    <p>"No, Huzoor!," said Birbal. "I did not belittle you. The full moon diminishes and disappears whereas the quarter moon grows from strength to strength. What I, in fact, proclaimed to the world is that your power is growing from day to day whereas that of the King of Persia is about to go into decline."</p>
    <p>Akbar grunted in satisfaction and welcomed Birbal back with a warm embrace.</p>
