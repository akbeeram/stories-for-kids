    <p>The Emperor Akbar was traveling to a distant place along with some of his courtiers. It was a hot day and the Emperor was tiring of the journey.</p>
    <p>"Can't anybody shorten this road for me?" he asked querulously.</p>
    <p>"I can/' said Birbal.</p>
    <p>The other courtiers looked at one another, perplexed. All of them knew there was no other path through the hilly terrain.</p>
    <p>The road they were traveling on was the only one that could take them to their destination.</p>
    <p>"You can shorten the road?" said the Emperor. "Well, do".</p>
    <p>"I will,-'said Birbal. "Listen first to this stray I have to tell." And riding beside the Emperor....</p>
    <p>....upon a long and intriguing tale that held Akbar and all those listening, spellbound. Before they knew it, they had reached the end of their journey.</p>
    <p>"We've reached?" exclaimed Akbar. "So soon!"</p>
    <p>"Well," grinned Birbal, "you did say you wanted the road to be shortened."</p>
