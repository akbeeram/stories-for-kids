    <p>One day the Emperor Akbar saw a woman hugging a very dark, ugly and unattractive child. He was very surprised to see that. He thought and thought but could not think why? He asked Birbal why she was doing that to such an unattractive child. Birbal replied innocently, "Huzoor, he must have been her own child, For every mother, her own child is the most beautiful in the world.</p>
    <p>The Emperor did not seem to be convinced with this explanation and Birbal had guessed this from the Emperor's face. Next day m the presence of the Emperor, Birbal ordered a guard to present the most beautiful child in the world in the court. Next day, the guard brought a more unattractive and ugly child with buck teeth and his hair stood like a porcupine and presented to the Emperor. "This is the most beautiful child in the world, Your Majesty." the guard stammered.</p>
    <p>The Emperor asked, "How do you know that he is the most beautiful child in the world?" "Your Majesty, I went home and posed my problem to my wife. She told me to bring our child to the court." the guard replied meekly.</p>
