    <p>Akbar then unfastened his waist cloth and lay on the floor. He then challenged the courtiers to cover hi from head to toe with the cloak.</p>
    <p>One by One the curtiers tried, but their attempts proved futile. If the head was covered, the feet remained exposed. Some even tried pulling and tugging at the cloak but in vain.</p>
    <p>Just then Birbal entered. The Emperor asked Birbal if he could do it. Birbal took the cloak and then looked at the Emperor lying on the floor.</p>
    <p>"Jahanpannah, would you kindly draw up your knees?" he said. The Emperor drew up his knees. Birbal then threw the cloak over him and it covered him from head to toe.</p>
    <p>The courtiers, realizing that they had failed the test, quietly filed out of the room.</p>
