    <p>A man who made spears and shields once came to Akbar's court.</p>
    <p>"Your Majesty, nobody can make shields and spears to equal mine. My shiled are so strong that nothing can pierce them and my spears are so sharp that there's nothing they cannot pierce."</p>
    <p>"I can prove you wrong on one count certainly", said Birbal suddenly.</p>
    <p>"Impossible", declared the man.</p>
    <p>"Hold up one of your shields and I will pierce it with one of your spears," said Birbal with a smile.</p>
