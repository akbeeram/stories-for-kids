    <p>It was winter. The ponds were all frozen.</p>
    <p>At the court, Akbar asked Birbal, "Tell me Birbal! Will a man do anything for money?" Birbal replied, 'Yes'.</p>
    <p>The Emperor ordered him to prove it.</p>
    <p>Birbal brought a Brahmin who merely had a penny left with him. His family was starving.</p>
    <p>Birbal told the King that the Brahmin was ready to do anything for the sake of money.</p>
    <p>The King ordered the Brahmin to be inside the frozen pond all through the night without any dress if he needed money.</p>
    <p>The poor Brahmin had no choice. The whole night he was inside the pond, shivering. He returned to the durbar the next day to receive his reward.</p>
    <p>The King asked "Tell me Oh poor Brahmin! How could you withstand the extreme temperature all through the night?"</p>
    <p>The innocent Brahmin replied "I could see a faintly glowing light a kilometer away and I withstood with that ray of light".</p>
    <p>Akbar refused to pay the Brahmin his reward saying that he had got warmth from the light and withstood the cold and that was cheating.</p>
    <p>The poor Brahmin could not argue with him and so returned disappointed and bare-handed.</p>
    <p>Birbal tried to explain to the King but the King was in no mood to listen to him.</p>
    <p>Thereafter, Birbal stopped coming to the durbar and sent a messenger to the King saying that he would come to the court only after cooking his khichdi.</p>
    <p>Birbal had lit the fire and kept the pot of uncooked khichdi one meter away from it.</p>
    <p>Akbar questioned him "How will the khichdi get cooked with the fire one meter away? What is wrong with you Birbal?"</p>
    <p>Birbal, cooking the khichdi, replied "Oh my great King of Hindustan! When it was possible for a person to receive warmth from a light that was a kilometer away, then it is possible for this khichdi, which is just a meter away from the source of heat, to get cooked.".</p>
    <p>Akbar understood his mistake. He called the poor Brahmin and rewarded him 2000 gold coins.</p>
