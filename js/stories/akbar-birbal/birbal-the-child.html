    <p>Birbal arrived late for a function and the Emperor was displeased.</p>
    <p>"My child was crying and I had to placate him," explained the courtier.</p>
    <p>"Does it take so long to calm down a child?" asked the Emperor. "It appears you know no thing about child rearing. Now you pretend to be a child and I shall act as your father and I will show you how you should have dealt with your child. Go onu Ask me for whatever he asked of you."</p>
    <p>"I want a cow," said Birbal.</p>
    <p>Akbar ordered a cow to be brought to the palace. "I want its milk. I want its milk," said Birbal, imitating the voice of a small child.</p>
    <p>"Milk the cow and give to him," said Akbar to his servants.The cow was milked and the milk was offered to Birbal. He drank a little and then handed the bowl back to Akbar.</p>
    <p>"Now put the rest of it back into the cow, put it back, put in back, put it back..." wailed Birbal.</p>
    <p>The Emperor was flabbergasted and quietly left the room.</p>
