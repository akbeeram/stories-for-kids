    <p>One day Akbar was stumbled on a rock in his garden while taking a stroll. He was not in a good mood already, and then this fall. He got very angry and ordered for the gardener's arrest and execution.</p>
    <p>The next day, at the time of execution, the gardener was asked what his last wish was. He requested for an audience with the Emperor. His wish was granted and he was brought in the court. When he came near the throne, he loudly cleared the throat and spat at the feet of the Emperor.</p>
    <p>The Emperor demanded to know why did he do such a thing. The gardener did this on Birbal's advice, so Birbal stepped forward in the gardener's defense.</p>
    <p>He said, "There could be no person more loyal than this unfortunate gardener. Fearing that you ordered him for hanging for a small reason, he went out of his way to give you a genuine reason for ordering him to be hanged."</p>
    <p>The Emperor realized his mistake and set him free.</p>
