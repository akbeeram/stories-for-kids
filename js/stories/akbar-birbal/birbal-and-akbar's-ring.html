    <p>Once Akbar went for hunting and there his ring fell in a dry well. Now how to take that ring out. They did not have any means to take it out. Then Birbal said, "Huzoor, if you give me some time I can take your ring out of this well." Akbar had no alternative.</p>
    <p>Birbal went around and brought some fresh cow dung and threw it on the ring. He then tied stone to one end of a string and holding the other end in his hand, threw the stone on the cow dung very hard so that it stuck onto the ring.</p>
    <p>He waited for a long time - cow dung to be dried, and then pulled the string out of the well. The string brought the stone, the stone was stuck into cow dung and the cow dung had the Emperor's ring at its bottom.</p>
