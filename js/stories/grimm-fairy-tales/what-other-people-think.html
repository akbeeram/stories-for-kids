    <p>Once upon a time . . . a farmer and his son went to market to sell a donkey. However, they loaded the beast into the wheelbarrow, so
        that it would not reach market tired and worn out, and pushed it along the road. When people saw such a peculiar sight, they loudly
        remarked: "That man is mad! Whoever saw a donkey being taken to market in a wheelbarrow!" The poor farmer became more and
        more confused, for the farther he went, the louder the comments became and the more people gossiped. It was the last straw when,
        as they passed the blacksmith's forge, the smith jeeringly asked the farmer if he wanted shoeing, since he was doing the donkey
        work! So the farmer stopped, heaved the animal out of the wheelbarrow and climbed o nto its back, while his son walked behind. But
        that made matters even worse! A group of women going home from market instantly complained: "You cruel man! Fancy a great lump
        like you riding a donkey, while your poor little boy runs along behind! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!" People heaped insult upon
        insult, till the unhappy farmer slid off the donkey . He simply did not know what to do next. He took off his cap and mopped his
        brow. "Whew!" he exclaimed. "I never imagined it could be so difficult to take a donkey to market." Then he hoisted his little boy
        onto the donkey and walked along behind. This time, a cluster of men began to protest. "Look at that! There's a young lad sitting
        pretty as you please , on top of a donkey, while his weary old fathe r has to go on foot!" "It's a disgrace." Once again, father and son
        came to a halt. How on earth could they stop people from criticizing everything they did? Well, in the end, they both got on the
        donkey. "What heartless folk!" exclaimed the passers-by. "Two riders on one little donkey!" But by now the farmer had lost his
        patience. He gave the donkey a terrible kick, saying: "Giddy up! From now on, I'll do things my way, and pay no attention to what
        other people think!"</p>
