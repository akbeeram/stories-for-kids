    <p>Once upon a time . . . there was a prince who, after wandering the land searching for a wife, returned to his castle and told his
        unhappy parents that he had been unable to find a bride. Now, this young man was difficult to please, and he had not been greatly
        taken with any of the noble young ladies he had met on his travels. He was looking for a bride who was not only beautiful, but also
        well-born, with the elegance and manners found only in those of noble birth and background.</p>
    <p>One evening, during a fierce hurricane
        that had suddenly blown up, a persistent knocking was heard at the castle door. The prince's father sent a servant to find out who
        was there. Standing on the steps, lit by flashes of lightning, in the driving rain, was a young lady.</p>
    <p>"I'm a princess," she said," seeking
        shelter for myself and my page. My carriage has broken down and the coachman can't repair it till tomorrow."</p>
    <p>In the meantime, the
        prince's mother had appeared to welcome the guest. She stared disapprovingly at the girl's muddy wet garments, and decided to
        find out if she really was of gentle birth.</p>
    <p>"Prepare a soft bed in the Blue Room," she said, "I'll come myself and make sure
        everything is in order." She told the servants to lay a pile of soft quilts on top of the mattress, and under the mattress she hid a
        pea. Then she showed the girl to her room. The rain beat down all night and lightning streaked the sky.</p>
    <p>In the morning, the prince's
        mother asked her guest: "Did you sleep well? Was the bed comfortable?" The girl politely replied: "it was a lovely soft bed, so soft
        that I could feel something hard under the mattress. This morning, I discovered it was a pea. It kept me awake all night!" The
        prince's mother offered her apologies, before rushing of to her son.</p>
    <p>"A real princess at last! Just think! She could feel the pea I hid
        under the mattress! Now, only a well-born lady could do that! The prince had finally found the bride of his dreams. After the
        wedding, the pea was placed inside a gold and crystal box and exhibited in the castle museum.</p>
