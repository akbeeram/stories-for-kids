    <p>Once upon a time . . . in Persia there lived a handsome young man called Sasha, who was the Ruler and greatly loved by all. Sasha had
        only one enemy, Kashenor, a cruel wicked wizard whose desire was to put his own son Mizrah on Sasha's throne. Sasha loved to
        collect ancient precious objects, and he always granted an audience to any passing merchants. One day, Kashenor, disguised as a
        merchant, was taken by Mansor, the Chief Minister, before Sasha. The Ruler bought everything the merchant offered him, but he
        also asked what was inside a small drawer in an antique box. "I really don't know myself," replied Kashenor, pulling out of the drawer  an old roll of paper written in a long-forgotten language, together with a tobacco jar full of black powder. "I'll give it to you as a
        present," he told the Ruler. Sasha wanted to know what the writing meant, so he gave the paper to his wise men, and a few days
        later, they told him what it said: "The man that reads these words will acquire the power to turn himself into an animal, any animal
        he likes, and to know its language. All he must do is to sniff the black powder and say the word MUTABOR. To turn back to a man
        again, he must bow three times to the east and repeat the word!" But the roll of paper also contained a warning. It told the reader
        he must never laugh when in his animal shape, for he would then forget the magic word forever. "Did you hear that, Mansor!"
        exclaimed the Ruler. "We can turn into animals! Shall we do it?" "Sire, I'll do whatever you want me to," replied the Chief Minister
        with a low bow. "Good! Then we'll try it tomorrow." At dawn next day, the Ruler and his Minister left the palace, and when they were
        well out of sight, Sasha took the tobacco jar from his pocket. "What animal shall we choose?" he asked the Minister. Now Mansor
        had no idea, till he noticed a stork glide past. "Storks!" he cried. "Let's become storks!" Sasha sniffed the powder and together the
        two said the word MUTABOR. Suddenly, their legs shoveled into long thin limbs and their clothes became snowy white feathers,
        covering their whole bodies. All trace of the Ruler and his Chief Minister simply vanished. The two storks gaped at each other in
        astonishment. They flapped their wings and discovered they knew how to fly. At first, they were awkward, but soon became quite
        good at it. "Doesn't the ground look so different from the air? Let's go and find other storks," suggested Sasha cheerfully, so they
        headed towards a river estuary. What a lot of bird things they learned on the way. Sasha and Mansor found it so silly to see a stork
        prancing stiffly around in his funny dance that they forgot all about the warning and began to laugh. They were later to regret
        bitterly that laughter . . . Full of their new knowledge, the two storks decided, as the afternoon wore on, to return to the palace.
        Slowly and majestically they flew over the city. Something had happened in their absence, for they could see that the streets were
        thronged with spectators and a long procession was entering the portals of the palace. Sasha was furious to see a stranger sitting in
        his golden carriage, escorted by his own servants and guards. Wicked Kashenor's trick had worked, for the wizard's son was on his
        way to seize the Ruler's throne. "Hurry!" urged Sasha. "We must dash back to the palace. Who is that imposter?" "It's the son of
        Kashenor, that wizard you once banned from the palace," replied Mansor in horror. "He swore he'd get even. Remember?" But even
        as he spoke, the Chief Minister shook with fear, for what he himself could not remember was the magic word. The two storks landed
        on the ground, ready to become humans again, but Sasha could only stammer . . . "I don't remember . . . I don't remember . . ." They
        looked at each other sadly: "We'll never be human beings again!" Followed by the Ruler, the Chief Minister rose into the air. "We'll
        go to Mecca and pray on the Prophet's tomb. Perhaps he'll help us remember the magic word." But Mecca was a long way away and
        the sun was setting. Tired and hungry, the two storks landed amongst the ruins of an old temple. As they looked around them,
        seeking food and water, a sudden long-drawn out screech made them jump in fright. Who on earth was living in such a lonely place?
        Sasha plucked up courage. "Let's go and find out!" he said, and off they went through the crumbled buildings. From a dark corner a
        pair of big yellow eyes glowed and the mournful cry of some strange creature echoed louder than before. It was a huge owl. "Thank
        goodness," it said, "I've been waiting for years. The spell is sure now to be broken..." Sasha and Mansor stared at each other in
        amazement on hearing the owl talk. "Who are you?" they asked it. "I'm Naja, the King of India's daughter. Many years ago, an evil
        wizard called Kashenor wanted me to marry his son Mizrah, so that he could seize my father's kingdom. One day, disguised as a
        slave, Kashenor gave me a cool drink in the garden. That turned me into an owl. Kashenor said I'd remain a horrible bird till the day
        someone came, wanting to marry me. That's why I've been sentenced to making my home in these ruins." "So you're one of
        Kashenor's victims too!" exclaimed the Ruler, and he went on to tell the owl his own story. "What shall we do now?" they asked
        themselves. "There's hope yet," replied the owl. "For now and again, Kashenor meets the other wizards in one of the ruined halls.
        While they're banqueting, they boast of what they've done. If Kashenor should brag of what he did to you, then he might repeat
        the magic word you've forgotten!" "Goodness, yes!" agreed the storks. "Let's go to the hall." But the owl sat where she was. "Before
        we go," she said, "one of you must promise to marry me. Otherwise I'll remain a bird forever!" "Very well! I promise I'll marry you,
        but only if I manage to hear the magic word and break the spell," said the Ruler. So the owl led the storks along a narrow passage
        beneath the temple, to a hall. "This is their meeting place. We can spy on them from this hole." The three birds took turns at
        keeping watch. Then one evening, the murmur of voices announced the arrival of the wizards. As they ate and toasted each other's
        health, Kashenor rose to his feet. "Guess how I succeeded in placing my son on the Ruler's throne?" he said, and when the wicked
        wizard said the word MUTABOR, the two storks thrilled with delight. "Mutabor! Mutabor!" they repeated. " That's the magic word!"
        Outside in the open air, the storks bowed three times to the east and said the magic word. Instantly they became men again, and
        the owl magically turned into a beautiful young lady. The three hugged each other with joy. "I will keep my promise," he assured her,
        "and when I am on my throne, I shall marry you." The Ruler's next task was to depose Mizrah. Stealing the wizards' camels, they
        rode all night, and dawn found them at the city gates. "The Ruler is alive!" cried the first people to see them. As they rode through
        the streets, the citizens pressed round, cheering wildly. "Sasha has come back! Mizrah has lied to us!" The wizard's nasty plan had
        failed. With a handful of followers, Mizrah had succeeded in seizing the throne, certain that Sasha would never be seen again. But
        when he heard the news, the wizard's son tried to escape. However, he was captured and thrown into prison. Kashenor too was put in
        chains, and the citizens themselves pronounced the sentence, when they learned what he and his son had done. "Death! Put them to
        death!" shouted the Ruler's subjects. And so the wizard was executed. Mizrah, instead, was forced to sniff the black powder that
        had caused all the trouble and speak the magic word MUTABOR. He instantly turned into a stork and was sent to live in a cage at the
        top of the highest turret. And in the end, this whole affair, brought much happiness to the palace, for Naja turned out to be the
        perfect wife of Sasha's dreams.</p>
