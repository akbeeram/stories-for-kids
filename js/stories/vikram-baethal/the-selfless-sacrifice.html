    <p>King Vikram ran to the peepal tree and pulled the Vaethal and started walking. The Vaethal told, "Oh Brave king! Listen to my story carefully and answer my question."</p>
    <p>Chandrasen was a brave, generous and kind ruler. One day a brahmin named Vishnu came to his court seeking for a job. The king was impressed by his intelligence and told, "You'll be my personal guard. What pay do you expect from me?"</p>
    <p>"One hundred gold coins per day" the man replied. The king agreed to it though he felt that the amount was too high. So he sent his spies to find out how Vishnu was spending his salary. The king was reported that Vishnu spent a huge portion of his salary for the poor and needy. So he was very happy to have Vishnu as his personal guard.</p>
    <p>One night King Chandrasen heard the crying of a lady near his palace. He ordered Vishnu to go and see the lady.</p>
    <p>Vishnu found a lady crying in the crematory. "Why are you crying lady?" asked Vishnu. She said, "I am goddess Lakshmi. Saturn is going to bring great harm to the King Chandrasen. As the king is my true devotee, I am crying for him."</p>
    <p>Vishnu asked, "Is there no way to overcome this misfortune?" Goddess Lakshmi replied, "If a person sacrifices his own son in the Mahakali temple, Saturn will not harm the King."</p>
    <p>As Vishnu wanted to save the king he ran to his home and explained all the things to his wife, son and daughter. The brave son said, "Father, sacrifice my head to Goddess Kali." So they rushed to the temple. In the meantime the king was following Vishnu all his way.</p>
    <p>In the temple Vishnu beheaded his only son in front of Kali. Unable to bear the death of the boy his mother, sister and father Vishnu also killed themselves one by one. The king was moved by the scene ana he also killed himself.</p>
    <p>The Vaethal asked Vikramaditya, "Vikram! Answer me whose sacrifice is selfless?" Vikram answered, "Vishnu sacrificed his son for the well being of the king as it was his duty. The other family members sacrificed their lives because they cannot live without each other. The king need not have died. But his love for his people made him die. So it was the most selfless."</p>
    <p>The Vaethal praised the wisdom of the king and flew back to the peepal tree.</p>
