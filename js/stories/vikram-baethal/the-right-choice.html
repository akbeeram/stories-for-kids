    <p>King Vikram without being discouraged ran after the Vaethal and pulled him from the peepal tree. The Vaethal inside the corpse started to tell another story.</p>
    <p>The King of Vaishali had a daughter named Vasantsena. She was a wise and beautiful maiden. So the princes of neighbouring states were very eager to marry her.</p>
    <p>One day the prince of Kalinga visited the king of Vaishali. He said, "Your majesty, I wish to marry your daughter." The king replied "O prince, I want to know about your special talent." The prince said, "I am a skilful archer and can hit the target without seeing it." The king asked the prince to stay as his guest in his palace for a while.</p>
    <p>Next day, the prince of Kampilya visited the King's court. He expressed his wish to marry the princess Vasantasena.</p>
    <p>He was an expert in weaving unique clothes. The king asked him also to stay in his palace.</p>
    <p>On the third day, the prince of Anga visited the king adn exhibited his special talent of understanding the conversation of birds and animals. The king was impressed by his talent and made him also stay as his guest.</p>
    <p>On the fourth day, the prince of Kanchi visited the king. He was very eager to marry Vasantasena. He was a great scholar and philosopher.</p>
    <p>Now the king wanted to choose one among the four as the groom for his daughter. He left the choice to his daughter herself.</p>
    <p>The Vaethal stopped the story and asked, "Vikram, whom would be the choice of princess Vasantasena?" The king replied, "As Vasantasena was a wise princess her choice must be the prince of Kalinga. Because the other three princes with their talents do not match with their background. But prince Kalinga had a talent which suited his royal background."</p>
    <p>The Vaethal said, "Vikram, your knowledge of analysis is great and you are correct but itâ€™s time for me to go." It flew away once again.</p>
