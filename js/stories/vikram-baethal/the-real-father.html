    <p>The Vaethal started to tell another story. It was like this:</p>
    <p>A poor brahmin lived in the city of Banaras. He had a beautiful daughter named Satyavati. The girl attained the marriable age. But her father could not find a suitable groom for her because of his poverty.</p>
    <p>One night Satyavathi heard a loud noise. She woke up and found a young man in her room. She was frightened very much "Who are you?" she asked trembling. He replied, "I am a thief. The king's guards are coming in search of me. Please protect me from them and I'll be thankful to you and will not do any harm to you." She trusted him and protected him in her house. After this incident the two met quite frequently. They fell in love with each other and got married secretly. They lived happily.</p>
    <p>One day the thief was caught by the king's guards and sentenced to death.</p>
    <p>In the mean while Satyavathi's father without knowing his daughter’s love story got her married to another man.</p>
    <p>Satyavathi was very sad and afraid because she was carrying the thief s baby in her womb.</p>
    <p>After giving birth to a baby boy Satyavathi died. But her husband brought up the baby boy with great affection and love. When the boy attained his teenage his father also died. He was very sad due to his father’s death. But he managed to settle his life.</p>
    <p>One day he went to the river Ganga to give offerings to his parent's soul. After performing rituals he entered the water to let the offerings. Suddenly three hands came out of the water to accept his offerings. The young man asked the hand wearing Bangles ’’Who are you?." It replied "I am your mother, my son." He offered to that hand. He asked the second hand, "Who are you?"</p>
    <p>"1 am your father", said the second hand.</p>
    <p>He asked the third hand "And who are you?"</p>
    <p>"I am your father" replied the third hand. He was confused and asked "How can I have two fathers?" The third hand said "I am your father because I brought you up with great care and affection."</p>
    <p>The second hand said, "I am your father as you came to this world because of me."</p>
    <p>The Vaethal stopped and asked the king, "Tell me, to which hand the young man would have given his offering?" The King replied, "If he was a wise man, he would have given his offerings to the third hand because the second father brought him up with great care, while the first father was just responsible for his birth."</p>
    <p>You are correct. But you broke your silence and so I am going away." Saying this the Vaethal flew away.</p>
