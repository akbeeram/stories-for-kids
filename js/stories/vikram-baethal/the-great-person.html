    <p>As King Vikram had promised the saint to bring the Vaethal, he was firm and so he ran to the peepal tree and once again put it on his shoulders and started walking. The Vaethal said to Vikram, "King, this journey is a great bore, so listen to my story."</p>
    <p>A rich merchant lived in a kingdom called Chanakyapuri. He had an unmarried son named Hrishikesh. In that kingdom adultery was an unpardonable sin liable to death sentence.</p>
    <p>One day Hrishikesh fell in love with a girl named Malini. He proposed her to marry. But as she was already engaged to a man named Jaiendra her father refused his proposal. Hrishikesh was disappointed and fell ill. On hearing his fate Malini wrote a letter to console him. In that letter she promised to meet him on the very day of her marriage in her bridal dress.</p>
    <p>Later she was married to Jaiendra. On her wedding day she told her husband all that happened earlier. </p>
    <p>As Jaiendra was moved by his wife's truthfulness he allowed her to meet Hrishikesh On her way to Hrishikesh's house a thief stopped her to rob her jewels. She begged the thief. "Please allow me now. I'll come back soon and will give all my jewels." She also explained her story to him. The thief was moved by her honesty and let her go.</p>
    <p>She reached Hrishikesh's house. On seeing her he was afraid of the King's men because he would be punished for adultery as Malini is married now. So he chased her out of his house. Malini was seriously wounded by his behaviour. On her way back she met the thief. "Why are you crying?" asked the thief. She narrated him what happened. As he felt pity for her he let her go without robbing her.</p>
    <p>When she reached her husband he also refused to accept her and chased her away. As she was insulted by both the guys she could not bear the sorrow and ended her life.</p>
    <p>Now the Vaethal asked, "King Vikram, who was the greatest person by character among the four in this story?" The King replied, "Vaethal, Hrishikesh was scared of king's punishment. So he was not a great person. Malini had a reason to behave in a noble manner and as far Jaiendra, as he refused to accept Malini he is not a great person. But the thief whose job is to rob people gave up his job for the sake of a pity girl. So he was the greatest person by character." As soon as the Vaethal heard the King it flew away once again.</p>
