    <p>King Vikram carried down once again the Vaethal from the peepal tree. The Vaethal asked, "So you'll not give up your attempt of carrying me." The king walked firmly. The Vaethal started to narrate another story.</p>
    <p>One day princess Chandra, daughter of king Vasudev met a young chap in her garden. The young man was Vasu. She fell in love with him instantly. He also loved her. But as he was a common man he had to left the garden.</p>
    <p>On his way he met two brahmins who had mighty powers. The brahmins were Vishwaroop and Sankaroop. They promised to help the Vasu in getting the princess married to him.</p>
    <p>Sankaroop by his magical powers became an old man and turned Vasu as a young maiden. They reached the palace and met the King.</p>
    <p>Sankaroop, as the old man told the king, "Oh King, I am going for a pilgrimage. So please take care of my daughter Maya until I come back." The king agreed to take care of the young maiden.</p>
    <p>Vasu, as a young lady Maya, accompanied princess Chandra. When he removed the magical ring he became a man and they two enjoyed secret meetings. One day the minister's son proposed Vasu, who was in the form of a lady. So Vasu ran away to the Brahmins for help.</p>
    <p>Again they framed a plan. Sankaroop as the old man and Vishwaroop as a young man went to the palace. The old man asked, "King! I want to see my daughter." But the king was shocked to hear that the young maiden had disappeared from the palace.</p>
    <p>The old man cried, "I had promised this young man to give my daughter in marriage. But now you had lost my daughter. What will I do now?"</p>
    <p>The King calmed down the old man. He said, "I will give my daughter to that young man instead of your daughter." So princess Chandra was married to Vishwaroop according to all rituals. Then the Brahmins left the palace with Chandra. But Vasu when saw Chandra as the wife of Vishwaroop refused to accept her. He said, "Though Chandra was my lover, now she is your wife. So I can’t accept her." The Vaethal asked King Vikram "Oh King, answer me if the denial of Vasu was righteous or not?"</p>
    <p>The king replied, "It's righteous because Chandra had became the wife of Vishwaroop as per rituals and their marriage bond is sacred than the secret relation of Vasu and Chandra." The Vaethal praised the answers of king Vikram.</p>
    <p>Now King Vikramaditya hold the Vaethal tightly not letting him down to fly away. The Vaethal warned Vikram "Oh King, the sage awaiting for you is a cruel man and he is waiting there to sacrifice both of us, so be careful."</p>
    <p>The King reached the sage's place. The sage took the corpse from Vikram’s shoulder and threw it into the fire burning there. But quickly Vikram chopped the head of the sage with his sword. Suddenly the Vaethal in the fire turned into a beautiful Gandarva prince. He said, "I was cursed by this sage as a vaethal and now you had given me life by saving me from the curse.</p>
    <p>He requested King Vikram, "Oh king, please make record of the stories told by me and the wise answers given by you. They will be a treasure trove for the future generation."</p>
    <p>The King agreed and fulfilled the wish of the Gandharva prince. That is the history of the Stories of Vikram and Vaethal you have read so far.</p>
