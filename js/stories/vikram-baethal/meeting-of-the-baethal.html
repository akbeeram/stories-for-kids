    <p>King Vikramaditya was one of the bravest and righteous rulers of Historic India. His name and fame spread far and wide. He never refused anyone who approached him for help.</p>
    <p>One day a sage visited his court. He said "Oh king! I have brought you a wonderful fruit as my gift." The king asked the treasurer to keep the fruit in the treasury safely. The sage repeated his visit to the king's court with a fruit for several days. One day the sage asked, King Vikram, "What did you do with the fruits given by me?" The King replied, "Your holiness, the fruits are safe in the treasury." Then he ordered the treasurer to bring them. The fruits were all rotten. But the king found precious stones inside the fruits. He was surprised and enquired about the strange fruits.</p>
    <p>The sage replied that he got them by his spirtual powers. He added, HOh king! if you help me, I can increase my spirtual power and can do great things for your kingdom.‚Äù</p>
    <p>The King willingly agreed to help the saint for the prosperity of his kingdom. The saint said, "There is a forest called Tanakpuri forest near your capital. I want you to bring me a corpse hanging on a peepal tree from that forest. The vaethal living inside the corpse will help me to increase my spirtual power."</p>
    <p>So King Vikram set out for the challenge on the next new mooru night. The brave king found the corpse on the peepal tree. He pulled it from the tree to his shoulders and started walking to the place of the saint. Suddenly the corpse began to laugh aloud. The king shouted, "Who are you?" The corpse replied "Oh King Vikram, I am Vaethal, a ghost living in this corpse." The Vaethal also warned the king that the saint is not a good man.</p>
    <p>The Vaethal added, "I shall tell you a story while you are carrying me. You should not speak anything on hearing it. If you speak I will fly away to the peepal tree. Again at the end of the story, I will ask you a question, Knowing the answer if you do not tell me the answer your head will explode into thousand pieces." King Vikram accepted the condition of the vaethal. </p>
