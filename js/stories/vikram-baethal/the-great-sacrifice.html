    <p>King Vikram started walking with the Vaethal on his shoulders. The Vaethal started telling a story about a king called Jimut and his son Jimutvahan.</p>
    <p>Jimutvahan was a man of noble characters. He always showed great affection towards his fellowmen and animals around him.</p>
    <p>So he was very much loved by his people. But, his jealous relatives planned to fight a war against him to overthrow his kingdom. Jimutvan was very sad because thousands of his people will die if a war broke out. So willingly he gave up his throne to his relatives and went to the Himalaya mountains. There with his family he lead a hermit's life. There he married a girl named Malayavathi.</p>
    <p>One day when he was walking through the jungle with his wife he saw some heap of bones and asked, "What are they?" Malayavathi replied "They are the bones of Nagas killed by Garuda the king of Eagles."</p>
    <p>At that time a young Naga boy was brought as food for Garuda. The boy's mother cried, "Please some one help my son,( Jimyutvan was moved by the cry and said, Oh Mother, when Garuda comes 111 be his prey, so take your son away."</p>
    <p>Suddenly Garuda came there and took away Jimyutvan. He cried, "Let peace be all around." The Naga boy ran after the Garuda pleading, "O Garuda! please leave that noble man. Take me instead." Garuda was moved by the scene and it restored the life of Jimyutvan and said, "I will give you a boon. Ask for anything."</p>
    <p>Jimyutvan said, "Please give life to all those you have killed." The Garuda agreed and brought back them all, and it never killed anyone else.</p>
    <p>The Vaethal asked Vikram, "Tell me whose sacrifice is great, the Naga boy's or Jimyutvan's?" King replied, "As Jimyutvan was a noble man by his birth itself it was not a great thing to sacrifice his life. But the Naga boy from an ordinary family was ready to sacrifice his life for the sake of a noble man. So his sacrifice was greater than that of Jimyutvan's."</p>
    <p>"That's right,! King Vikram" said the Vaethal. But for me it's time to go and you know very well why!" Saying it, the Vaethal flew away to the peepal tree.</p>
