    <p>Though King Vikram was tired of the tedious job of bringing the Vaethal to the saint he continued his effort and carried the Vaethal. The Vaethal also continued to narrate a story.</p>
    <p>One day an old man came to the court of king Aryaputra and asked for help. He said, "Oh King, I am your cousin because I am the son of your mother's sister. Once I had a beautiful house but it has been destroyed now. I had two close friends but they betrayed me. Earlier I had two but now I have three."</p>
    <p>The king at first could not understand what the old man was saying. Soon he realised what the old man meant to say. As the old man was poor he was the son of Narayanee the goddess of poverty, while the rich king was the son of goddess Lakshmi. Lakshmi and Narayanee are sisters. So the old man was King's cousin. The beautiful home once he had was his youthful body. The two friends once with him were his ears and eyes. Earlier he could walk with two legs but now he had a third thing, a stalk for his support. The king was impressed by the knowledge of the old man. Suddenly the old man threw off his guise and a young man emerged in his place.</p>
    <p>He pleaded the king to forgive him and asked for a job. The king made him his royal minister. The young man was Aravinda. He performed his duty loyally to the king.</p>
    <p>One night Aravinda heard the crying of a lady outside the palace. He asked her "Who are you?" She replied, "I am goddess Lakshmi." "Why are you crying?" he asked. She replied,"I am going to leave this palace and my sister Narayanee is going to take my place." Aravinda questioned, "What can I do to avoid this situation." She said "If a loyal person to the king sacrifices his son to Goddess Kali this situation can be avoided." Aravinda rushed to his home.</p>
    <p>In the meantime the king was watching all the things secretly. Aravinda convinced his wife and took his only son to the temple. Their little daughter also followed him. In the temple Aravinda sacrificed his son before goddess Kali. On seeing this Aravinda's daughter also killed herself. Seeing the children dead, their mother also killed herself. Aravinda also killed himself. The king watching all this also killed himself.</p>
    <p>The Vaethal stopped and asked, "Oh! King, who is the noblest of all?" King Vikram replied, "The King is the noblest of all." "Why?" asked the Vaethal." In this story all the other three had a reason to sacrifice their life. But the king might have spared his life and lived happily; but he sacrificed it for his loyal minister. So he was the noblest man" answered the king.</p>
    <p>The Vaethal said, "You are correct. But I am going and catch me if you can" And so saying it flew away.</p>
