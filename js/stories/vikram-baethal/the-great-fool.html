    <p>Once again King Vikram reached the peepal tree and brought down the corpse. When he started walking the Vaethal began to narrate a story.</p>
    <p>Once there lived a Brahmin in the city of Banaras. He had four sons who were very lazy to learn new things. One day he to a Guru to acquire knowledge. After finishing their studies they were returning to their home. On their way in the jungle they saw a heap of bones.</p>
    <p>The first Brahmin boy in order to exhibit his knowledge chanted some mantras and suddenly the heap of bones rearranged themselves into a skeleton.</p>
    <p>The second boy also chanted some mantras and suddenly the skeleton got | covered by flesh. As soon as the third boy chanted the mantras the flesh was covered by skin. Now it was a huge dead lion.</p>
    <p>The fourth Brahmin boy without thinking of the consequences chanted the mantras to his part. Suddenly the lion got up alive and bounced upon them and killed them all.</p>
    <p>The Vaethal ended the story and said, "King Vikram, all the four Brahmin boys are fools but who was the greatest fool among them?" The king said "The four Brahmin boys without any common sense in order to exhibit their knowledge brought the heap of bones into a lion. But when they come to know it was a lion the fourth boy should have stopped chanting mantras in order to protect him and his brother's lives. But he failed to do so. So he was the biggest fool among them all.‚Äù</p>
    <p>The Vaethal shouted, "You are correct, but I am flying away because you failed to keep silence all through the journey."</p>
