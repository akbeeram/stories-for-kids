    <p>When the King Vikram reached the peepal tree he found the corpse hanging on it. He put it on his shoulders and started walking while the Vaethal began to narrate another story.</p>
    <p>King of Magadha had two brothers as his chief officers .The elder brother had the talent to judge the thoughts of people, while the younger brother had the talent to predict about an object just by touching or smelling it.</p>
    <p>One day the king was invited by his rival and neighbouring king for peace talks. The king went to the palace of his rival king with his chief officers.</p>
    <p>After dinner they were, given a royal bedroom to take rest. When the king was about to lay on the led the elder brother stopped the king. He said, I feel there is some danger in this pillow."</p>
    <p>Then they found some hairs dumped inside the pillow. The younger brother smelt it and said, "Oh king, these hairs are poisonous and it would have killed you." The king had a narrow escape that day due to the wisdom of his chief officers.</p>
    <p>Now the Vaethal asked, "King Vikram, answer me who is the most talented brother?"</p>
    <p>King replied instantly, "Why not! it is the elder brother because without smelling or touching an object he predicted the danger first."</p>
    <p>The Vaethal astonished by Vikram's wisdom flew away once again to the peepal tree. </p>
