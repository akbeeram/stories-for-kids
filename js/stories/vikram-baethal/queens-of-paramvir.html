    <p>Now it was another attempt of King Vikram to bring the Vaethal. As usual it started to tell a story.</p>
    <p>Paramvir was the king of Anga. He had three queens. He treated all the three equally. One day he was chatting with the first Queen Nalini in his Rose Garden.</p>
    <p>At that time a rose flower fell on the leg of Nalini and she cried out of pain because the flower had caused a severe wound on her leg. She had to be treated for one week.</p>
    <p>On one full moon night the king was sleeping with his second wife Tara. The king was waken up by the loud cry of the Queen. She cried "Oh! the moon light had burnt my body."</p>
    <p>The king was also shocked to see the burnt marks on her body. She was also treated for one week.</p>
    <p>The next day, when the king was strolling with the third queen Malathi in the courtyard she heard the sound of rice being pounded. On hearing this sound she fainted by closing her ears with her palms.</p>
    <p>The king was shocked to see heat boils on her palms. She was to be treated by the palace physicians.</p>
    <p>Now, the Vaethal asked "King Vikram, who was the most sensitive Queen of all the three?"</p>
    <p>King Vikram replied quickly, "Queen Malathi is the most sensitive. The other two queens were wounded by flower and moonlight which touched their bodies physically, but Malathi had heat boils even by the sound of grinding from a distant place."</p>
    <p>"Wonderful answer" said the Vaethal and it was once again to its way to the peepal tree.</p>
