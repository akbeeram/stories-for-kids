    <p>The Vaethal started to tell a story. A king named Chatursen ruled over Benares. After a long period of prayers the Queen gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. They named him Rohith.</p>
    <p>The boy grew up to a handsome and brave youngman. He had a friend called Amit. Though Amit was the son of palace washerman the prince treated him equally.</p>
    <p>One day prince Rohit saw a beautiful girl near the river. He fell in love with the girl. She was Sunitha, daughter of another washerman. Amit was also in love with her. But when he came to know the love of the prince he gave up his love for his friend's sake. In the meantime, the prince went to the temple of Kali and prayed", If I have Sunitha as my wife, I will sacrifice my head for you Goddess Kali on the coming full moon night.‚Äù</p>
    <p>When the king came to know about the love affair of his only son he arranged for the marriage of Sunitha and his son Rohith. Soon they were married with great joy.</p>
    <p>On the full moon night prince Rohith went to the temple of Goddess Kali with his wife and friend Amit. The prince asked them to wait outside the temple and he went alone inside. There he beheaded himself with his sword before the statue of Goddess Kali. As it took a long time, Amit went inside the temple to see his friend. There he was shocked to see the beheaded body of his dearest friend Rohit "I am not ready to live without my friend" he said and beheaded himself. When Sunitha entered the temple later she also beheaded herself because she was not ready to live without her loving husband.</p>
    <p>Goddess Kali was moved by the love of all these three and she gave life to Amit, Rohit and Sunitha. But She interchanged the heads of Amit and Rohit.</p>
    <p>The Vaethal stopped and asked King Vikram, "Oh! wise king, who is the rightful husband of Sunitha?" The King replied, "The person with the head of prince Rohith is the rightful husband because head overrules the body." The Vaethal said, "You are correct, but you have broken your silence and so Bye, Bye." The Vaethal flew back to the peepal tree. The King ran chasing the Vaethal.</p>
