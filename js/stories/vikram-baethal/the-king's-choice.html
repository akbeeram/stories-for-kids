    <p>Vikram was firm in taking the Vaethal to the saint. So he chased and took the Vaethal on his shoulders and walked. The Vaethal started to tell another story.</p>
    <p>Once Ujjain was ruled by a king named Balwant. He had a daughter named Apsara. The princess was a beautiful and wise girl. The king wanted the best life partner for her. After a long search he chose four princes for her. He wanted to select the best from them.</p>
    <p>One of the four princes was prince Paramvir from East. He was a brave soldier of great victories.</p>
    <p>The second was prince Dharamvir from South. He was a great philosopher. The third one was prince Shervir from North.He was a good merchant.</p>
    <p>The fourth one was Karamvir from West. He was a good social worker.</p>
    <p>Now Vaethal asked Vikram, "Tell me now oh! king who will be the right choice of the king . Balwant for his daughter Apsara?" King Vikram thought for a while and answered firmly, "Vaethal, as for as we see by the ability of the four princes, Karamvir was a shudra, Dharamvir was a brahmin, Shurvir was a vaishya. But as Dharamvir was a brave soldier he was a true shatriya. As Apsara was a daughter of a king to my knowledge the choice of king Balwant would be Dharamvir for his daughter Apsara."</p>
    <p>"Correct! Your knowledge of judgement is remarkable" praised the Vaethal. "But as you have opened your mouth, I am leaving you" said the Vaethal and flew away to the peepal tree.</p>
