    <p>King Vikram walked courageously towards the peepal tree. It was dark all around . The forest was filled with sounds of strange creatures. He found the corpse hanging on the peepal tree and pulled it for the twelth time. Once again the Vaethal started to tell a story.</p>
    <p>A king named Raghuvir of Kosala lost his kingdom in the game of Gambling. So he wandered in the forest without any shelter. One day he reached the hut of a sage and asked for some food. The sage gave him some fruits and nuts.</p>
    <p>But the king said, "I want to have more delicious foods than this."</p>
    <p>In order to satisfy the king, the sage created a palace with all facilities. The king was served with tasty foods and drinks by a beautiful maid and he slept soon.</p>
    <p>But when he awoke he was astonished to see himself on the floor.</p>
    <p>He ran to the sage and asked, "Where is the palace?" The sage replied "They are created by my magical powers and now they had disappeared."</p>
    <p>The king asked eagerly "Please teach me those tricks." The sage agreed and said "I will teach you some mantras and you had to chant it for forty days by standing in water on a single leg.”</p>
    <p>The king followed the instructions of the sage but he did not get any magical powers. So he once again persuaded the sage to teach him the secret. Now the sage said "Chant the mantras for forty days bystanding on the fire bed." But again the king was disappointed because he could not get the magical powers.</p>
    <p>The Vaethal asked king Vikram, 'Oh king! why did the king could not get the magical powers even though he followed the instructions of the sage?"</p>
    <p>Vikram replied "It’s no doubt that the King strictly chanted the mantras but his mind was full of wordly desires. So he could not get the desired magical powers."</p>
    <p>The Vaethal said, "Oh king, you are a wise king than many others, any now Good bye" and it flew away.</p>
