    <p>"Vikram, why not you hear this story?" asked the Vaethal and started a new story.</p>
    <p>Gunasheel was the ruler of Mithila. He was a man of great bravery and knowledge. So people from neighbouring states came to meet him. One day a man named Shukveer from a distant place came to his kingdom. Even after a year of waiting he could not meet the king. He also lost all ’his in this period of waiting.</p>
    <p>One day Shukveer decided to meet the king in the forest when he went there for hunting. So he followed the king. Meanwhile, the king got lost himself in the forest. He laid down very tired under a tree. Shukveer reached the king and said humbly, "Can, I help you Majesty?" The king asked "Who are you?"</p>
    <p>Shukveer told the king about himself. The king was moved by his affection. Then Shukveer offered the king some food as the King was very hungry. Then he said "My Lord, please accept me as your servant".</p>
    <p>The King was very happy to have such a loyal servant. After reaching Mithula, the king appointed Shukveer as his minister.</p>
    <p>One day Shukveer met a beautiful girl and fell in love with her. Next day Shukveer went to | the girl’s house with the king to ask for the consent of her mother. When she saw the king the girl said, "I wish to many you my Lord." Shukveer was disappointed. But he firmly said, "your majesty, if you wish you can marry her."</p>
    <p>The king asked the girl, "Why have you changed your mind?" The girl answered "Lord, I am a poor girl from my childhood, I had dreamt of a royal life. If I marry you I can get it and I can live in a palace." "Oh! so you want to live in a palace.I will give a palace to Shukveer. Will you marry him now?" The girl agreed to marry Shukveer.</p>
    <p>Now the Vaethal questioned King Vikram, "Who is more noble and generous? The king Gunaseel or Shukveer?" Vikram replied, "As Shukveer was the servant of the king he was ready to give up the girl for his king. But the king even though has the right to have the girl he made things for the well being of his subject Shukveer and got him married to that girl. So he was the most generous man."</p>
    <p>"You are absolutely right" said the Vaethal. "But you spoke inspite of my warning. So, I am going. Saying so it flew away swifty to the peepal tree.</p>
