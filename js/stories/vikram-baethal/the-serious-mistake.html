    <p>The Vaethal started to narrate another story. Once there lived a prince named Kumar. He had a friend named Abhiman. One day the two went for hunting in the forest. After a while they stopped in a temple to take rest. Prince Kumar sat on the stairs of the temple while Abhiman had gone for a bath in a nearby pond.</p>
    <p>The prince saw a beautiful girl coming out of the temple. He fell in love with her at the first sight. He came to know that she was princess Meghala of the neighbouring kingdom and she was already engaged to another person for marriage. But she also fell in love with the prince Kumar.</p>
    <p>When Abhiman returned from the pond he told him about his love. Abhiman wanted to help his friend. The next day they went in the disguise of ordinary men to meet princess Meghala. They conveyed a secret message to the princess to meet them.</p>
    <p>She came to meet them secretly. Abhiman, who was waiting in disguise there, robbed her jewels and ran away. He sold them all to a jeweller. But soon the king's guard recovered the jewels from the jeweller and they took him before the king. The honest jeweller told the truth to the king.</p>
    <p>The king asked the princess "How can a single man rob all your jewels?" The princess was afraid and she told about her love affair to the king. The king got angry and he chased her out of his kingdom. On the border of the kingdom prince Kumar waited with Abhiman. They took her to their kingdom. The two friends told her that this was their plan to get her married to Kumar.</p>
    <p>Now Vaethal paused and asked Vikram, "Who had done a serious mistake in this story?" Vikram said "Athiman's act was not wrong because he did all for the sake of his friend. The prince and princess were also not blameable because they did all for the love with each other. But the act of the king, the father of Meghala is wrong. He acted without considering the well and wish of his daughter. So he had done the serious mistake of chasing out his daughter."</p>
    <p>"You are correct" cheered the Vaethal. "But you had failed to keep my words. So I am leaving you." Saying this the Vaethal flew away. King Vikram ran after him through the forest.</p>
