    <p>A TURTLE lived in a pond at the foot of a hill. Two young wild Geese, looking for food,
        saw the Turtle, and talked with him. The next day the Geese came again to visit the
        Turtle and they became very well acquainted. Soon they were great friends.</p>
    <p>"Friend Turtle," the Geese said one day, "we have a beautiful home far away. We are
        going to fly back to it to-morrow. It will be a long but pleasant journey. Will you go with
        us?"</p>
    <p>"How could I? I have no wings," said the
        Turtle.</p>
    <p>"Oh, we will take you, if only you can keep
        your mouth shut, and say not a word to
        anybody," they said.</p>
    <p>"I can do that," said the Turtle. "Do take me
        with you. I will do exactly as you wish."</p>
    <p>So the next day the Geese brought a stick and they held the ends of it. "Now take the
        middle of this in your mouth, and don't say a word until we reach home," they said.</p>
    <p>The Geese then sprang into the air, with the
        Turtle between them, holding fast to the
        stick.</p>
    <p>The village children saw the two Geese
        flying along with the Turtle and cried out:
        "Oh, see the Turtle up in the air! Look at the
        Geese carrying a Turtle by a stick! Did you ever see anything more ridiculous in your
        life!"</p>
    <p>The Turtle looked down and began to say,
        "Well, and if my friends carry me, what
        business is that of yours?" when he let go,
        and fell dead at the feet of the children.</p>
    <p>As the two Geese flew on, they heard the
        people say, when they came to see the poor
        Turtle, "That fellow could not keep his
        mouth shut. He had to talk, and so lost his
        life."</p>
