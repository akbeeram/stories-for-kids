    <p>The brother of Tenali Raman's wife invited their house and stayed with them for some days. Both Raman and his wife treated him well. Ram used to bring fruits from the palace to his house and gave to his brother-in¬law.</p>
    <p>He found the fruits very different and tasty asked Raman from where he got them.</p>
    <p>Raman told him, “These are from the Maharaja's garden. If anybody try to steal them he will beheaded.”. But the boy did not listen to it.</p>
    <p>One day he went to the Royal garden in the night and tried to steal some fruits, but was got red handed by the guards. They brought him to the king who ordered to put the boy to death.</p>
    <p>Hearing this Raman went straight to the king. Knowing that Raman has come to save his brother-in-law, the king decided not to heed to his plead. He told Raman whatever he would request it will not be granted and the quite opposite will be ordered.</p>
    <p>Raman thought for a moment and said, “Maharaja, I request you to issue orders to i behead my brother-in-law.”. The king was surprised. What should he do? He had said that he would issue orders against what Raman would request.</p>
    <p>So he had no choice but to release Raman's brother-in-law. Everybody praised Raman's intelligent that saved the poor boy.</p>
