    <p>Tenali Raman was bom in a poor Brahmin family in Andhra Pradesh some five hundred years ago. At a very young age he lost his father. So he and his mother lived with his uncle at Tenali. He was not interested to study, but he was intelligent and naturally got a talent for speaking humourously. He was worried how to manage his livelihood.</p>
    <p>One day a sage came to Tenali. He took pity on Raman and taught him a mantra. He told Raman that if he would chant the mantra with devotion Mother Kali would appear before him and fulfill his wishes.</p>
    <p>Similarly Tenali Raman chanted the Mantra 1008 times and Goddess Kali appeared before him and asked him what he wanted.</p>
    <p>Tenali Raman folded his hands and said, “Oh Mother, I am suffering from  poverty. I pray you to remove away my poverty and make me intelligent. Kali laughed at him and said, “You seem to be greedy. You want both wealth and intelligence.I can grant you only one boon, ask it.” Raman said, “Mother Kali, one needs education to get famous, wealth to live without poverty. So please give me both.” Kali asked him to extend his hands and placed two cups containing milk on each of his hands and said, “The milk in one cup will.give you wealth and the other cup will give you intelligent. Drink the milk in one of the cups and you will get accordingly.” Raman thought for a moment and put the milk in the first cup into the second and mixed the two milks and drank it. “Now I have drunk the milk of one cup only” he said. “You didn't say not to mix them.”</p>
    <p>Kali smiled at him. She said, “Rama, you have won. You will be both intelligent and famous” and blessed him.</p>
