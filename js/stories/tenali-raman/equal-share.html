    <p>King Krishnadevaraya had planned for a Dance Drama programme in his palace. He had sent invitations to all except Tenali Raman.He thought that Tenali might insult the royal ladies with his wits and jokes.</p>
    <p>He gave orders to the gatekeeper not to ler Tenali inside when he comes to the theatre.</p>
    <p>Tenali Raman came to know of this. He decided to enter the theatre somehow. He went and tried to go inside, but the gate keepers didn't allow him to enter.</p>
    <p>He said to the gate keeper, “Friend, if I go inside I will get a lot prizes with my talents. When I return I will give you half of what I get."</p>
    <p>The gate keeper thought for a while and later allowed Tenali Raman to enter.</p>
    <p>There was a second gate and the gate keeper there, did not allow Tenali to enter. But he also was made to allow him after convincing that he would receive half of what Tenali would receive.</p>
    <p>Tenali went inside and sat in a comer unnoticed. The play was going on. In the play the man who acted as Krishna was getting blows by the gopis for stealing butter from their homes</p>
    <p>Tenali rose and gave some blows to the actor. The actor began to cry aloud.</p>
    <p>The king watching this grew angry. He brought Tenali to his side and asked him why he did what he did.</p>
    <p>Tenali said “Krishna was beaten by the gopis many times but he did not cry like this fellow ?</p>
    <p>The king was very angry to hear this. He ordered the servants to give thrity blows to Tenali.</p>
    <p>Tenali said, “Maharaja, please wait. I have promised to give fifty percent of what I get here to the gate keepers. So please bring them also and give them whatever I am getting.</p>
    <p>The kig ordered to bring the gate. They told the truth. The king gave orders to give fifteen blows to each of them and prizes to Tenali Raman. </p>
