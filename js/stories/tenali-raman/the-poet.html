    <p>One day a great poet named Vidyasagar visited the court of King of Vijayanagar. He.was well versed in all the sastas andpuranas. He was very proud that he alone had studied all the sastras. He used to go to every kingdm, call all. the poets and vidwans there for discussions and arguments.</p>
    <p>In the Vijayanagar court also he proved his talents. In the king's court there were three great scholars Pethanna, Susanna and Thimmanna. But even they couldn’t defeat Vidyasagar. The king was worried that there were no great scholars in his court.</p>
    <p>At this moment Tenali Raman came to the court. He asked the proud Pandit, “Gentlemen, I am ready to argue with you. Please come tomorrow.” The vidwans were happy and immediately accepted his invitation and agreed to come to the court the next day.</p>
    <p>The next day Tenali Raman came to the court in well decorated costumes and ornaments. He was carryng with him a large bundle covered with a silk cloth. Just before the commencement of the discussion, one of the pundits asked Tenali Raman what was in the bundle.</p>
    <p>Tenali Raman casually replied that the bundle was a great literary work named Tilakashta Mahisha Bandanam.' He was going to argue on the basis of the contents of this great work.</p>
    <p>Vidyasagar was greatly puzzled. He had never heard of this classic work. He was confused. How could he answer if Tenali raised auctions from the master work? What will happen if he couldn't answer correctly? But he said, “OK, we shall meet tomorrow and discuss.</p>
    <p>In the night Vidyasagar couldn't sleep: He was thinking of what would happen the next day. He had never heard of the work Tilakashta Mahisha p^nftanam He didn't want the feel of the bitter taste of failure. So he immediately left the town in the night itself without telling anybody.</p>
    <p>Next day in the court the king asked Raman to show his great literary work. When he uncovered the bundle, every one was surprised that there was no palm leaf literary work, but sesame plant, some sticks and a rope for tying buffalos. He explained that tilak means sesame, kashta means sticks, mahisha andanam means the rope that binds the uffalo. Every one laughed at Raman’s wit and the king presented him with prizes.</p>
