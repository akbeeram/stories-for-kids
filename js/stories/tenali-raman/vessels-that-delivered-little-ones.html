    <p>There once lived a merchant in Vijayanagar He used to lend money to poor people and collect exorbitant interest for the loans. Sometimes he used to levy 50 paise interest for a loan of one rupee. People had no way than approaching him at times of difficulty. He even gave loans on vessels also and and get interest on them.</p>
    <p>Tenali Raman decided to put an end to the merchant’s greedy practice.</p>
    <p>One day he went and requested the ] merchant some big vessels as loan for the ear boring ceremony of his daughter to be held in his house two days later. The merchant gave tne necessary vessels.</p>
    <p>Five days later Tenali Raman returned the vessels to the merchant. He also gave some small vessels along the vessels he borrowed and said, “Sir, the vessels I took from you were pregnant. The delivered the little vessels when they were in my house. Naturally they belong to you and I have brought them with me. Please take them also.”</p>
    <p>The merchant was surprised and thought Raman was a fool, but gladly accepted the little vessels and thanked Raman.</p>
    <p>Some days later Raman again went to the merchant and borrowed some silver vessels. The merchant gladly gave them and said, “Don't forget to bring the young ones also, as these vessels are also pregnant.”</p>
    <p>Tenali Raman took the vessels to his house. But he did not return them to the merchant. The merchant waited for some | days and went to see Raman.</p>
    <p>As soon as Raman saw the merchant he began to cry loudly. When the merchant asked him what the matter was, Raman said with tears in his eyes, “Oh brother, how can I tell the bad news. Your vessels were alright when I took them from you, but within a few days they developed some disease and died the next day. What can I do now?” The merchant got very angry. He said, “Are you joking? How can the vessels die?” Tenali said, “When I said earlier the vessels had delivered little ones, you believed my words. But now when I say they were dead because of illness, you are not ready to believe me. Why?"</p>
    <p>The merchant took him to the king and pleased for justice. Tenali told the king about the merchant's habit of levying high interest on loans and he has done this to teach the merchant a lesson only.</p>
    <p>The king understood and praised Tenali for way he taught a lesson to the merchant. He ordered the merchant to levy only reasonable interest on loans and sent them away.</p>
