    <p>Tenali Raman was very ill. A vaidya came and saw him. He told Raman thathis illness was a worse type and it would take a large sum of money to treat him.</p>
    <p>Tenali went to a merchant to get a loan. The merchant asked Tenali when he would repay the amount.</p>
    <p>Tenali had a horse which was a high breed. It would fetch a huge price. He told the merchant that he would sell the horse and return the money to the merchant after he was cured of his illness. The merchant agreed to this proposal and gave Raman the medicines he required and Raman got cured of his illness in a few days. But he didn't return the amount to the merchant.</p>
    <p>When the merchant came to him, Tenali said, "Come with me to the market. I will sell my horse and return your money.”</p>
    <p>Both went to the market. Raman took with him his horse. He also took a cat with In the market Tenali's horse was a great attraction. People surrounded it and discussed about its price. One rich man wanted to buy the horse and asked for the price.</p>
    <p>Tenali said, “I am going to sell my horse just for one rupee. But on one condition. The purchaser should buy my cat also along with the horse. The price of the cat is only three thousand rupees.”</p>
    <p>Raman's words surprised the rich man. Anyhow he paid 3001 rupees and took both the horse and the cat with him.</p>
    <p>When the merchant came to Tenali Raman for the loan amount, Tenali gave him just one rupee. The merchant refused to accept it and they both went to the king for justice.</p>
    <p>Tenali narrated the king the whole story. He said, “Maharaja, I told this merchant that I will sell my horse and give the amount to him and he agreed. I sold the horse for one rupee, but now he refuses to accept it.”</p>
    <p>The king understood the situation and delivered his judgment in favour of Tenali Raman.</p>
