    <p>Once there was heavy draught in the Vij ayanagar kingdom. There was no rain and the tanks and rivers went dry. There was no water in the well in Tenali's garden.</p>
    <p>So he found it very difficult to water the plants in the garden.One day he came to know four thieves were hiding in his garden. He called his wife and said in a loud voice so that the thieves could hear, “Dear, there is no rain for the last many months.There were thefts here and there. So we must be careful. Let us do something."</p>
    <p>"What can we do?" asked his wife.</p>
    <p>"Bring all our jewels and put them in this box. Then we put the box into the well. Later when the famine is over and fear of theft is gone, we may take again the box from the Well."</p>
    <p>The thieves were hearing all these. At the same time Tenali said to his wife in a low voice about the presence of the thieves.</p>
    <p>They put some stones and wooden pieces into an old box and took it to the well and dropeed into the well.</p>
    <p>The thieves thought that Tenali has simplified their task and they can easily take the box from the well and get away. They came to the well. It was a deep one.</p>
    <p>One of them said, “There is not much water in the well. We can draw away it and take the box with the jewels.” All of them agreed and began to draw the water from the well.</p>
    <p>Tenali came out of his hiding place and direct the water to all the plants. The water in the well has not yet emptied. The thieves said to themselves that they could come the next day to drain the remaining water.</p>
    <p>Tenali came before them after watering all the plants. He said to the thieves, “Please don’t trouble yourselves by coming tomorrow. The water is now sufficient for three days. So come after three days if you wish. Anyhow thank you for the help.”</p>
    <p>The thieves was greatly surprised and ashamed. But within themselves there was praises for Tenali. But they didn't remain there to congratulate him, but ran out of that place as quickly as possible.</p>
