    <p>One the Sultan of Bijapur came to know about the strength of Kishnadevaraya's army. He also understood that Rayar was planningto attack him. The Sultan decided to stop it.</p>
    <p>He knew the king was strong believer in astrology. He met his royal astrologer and requested him to stop the war and for this he would give the astrologer a large amount of money.</p>
    <p>The greedy astrologer came to Vijayanagar palace. He understood that Krishnadevaraya was ready to attack Bijapur.</p>
    <p>He thought to stop this. He went straight to the Maharaj. He presented s if he was hesitating to reveal something bad to the king. Then he said, “Maharaja, your planetary positions now not favourable. So I advise you not to make any attempt for a war.</p>
    <p>The ministers and officers and the army chief were also of the same opinion because they were fond of the king's welfare. The king thought for a long time.</p>
    <p>Tenali Raman was watching all these. He had a doubt about the astrologer. So he said to the king, “Why are you hesitating, oh maharaja? The Words of the astrologer never comes true always.”</p>
    <p>The king accepted this and said, “You are correct Tenali Raman but how to convince to others? Do one thing. Announce that the one who proves that 1 the astrologer is wrong and he will get an award of thousand rupees.”</p>
    <p>Tenali Raman was happy. He said, “Mharaja, I myself will prove this. Please give me the rights to punish the astrologer if he is wrong.” The king accepted.</p>
    <p>Next day in the Royal Hall, the astrologer and Tenali Raman were sitting in the opposite sides . Raman was watching the astrologer very carefully. Then he asked him, “Do you believe what you predict will surely happen?”</p>
    <p>“Why do you doubt it?” asked he astrologer.”</p>
    <p>Raman said politely, “You may live for many more years and deliver forecasts to many people.”</p>
    <p>The astrologer nodded his head. Raman asked, “Oh, then you will surely live some forty years more?”</p>
    <p>“No doubt” said the astrologer.</p>
    <p>“But your words are gone wrong” said Raman and drew the sword of the chief guard and cut off the head of the astrologer.</p>
    <p>Everybody was taken aback. Raman took the palm leaf bundle of the astrologer and there was hidden in between the palm leaves a secret letter from the king of Bijapur sent to the astrologer which proved that the astrologer was a secret agent of the king of Bijapur.</p>
    <p>The king praised Tenali Raman. He gave him ten thousand rupees as a reward for saving his life. Later he went on war against the king of Bijapur and conquered the kingdom.</p>
