    <p>One day King Krishnadevaraya was in a sad mood. “The Government is doing a lot to the people. But the benefit does not go and reach them,” he said to Tenali Raman.</p>
    <p>“Raman, what is the reason for it, do you know?” he asked Tenali.</p>
    <p>"Maharaja, I	know and I can tell	you. But it is better if I show then telling. Please let me have a big ice cube."</p>
    <p>The Maharaja was puzzled, but he ordered and a huge ice cube was brought. Tenali said, “Maharaja, give this ice cube to the Finance Minister. Then he will give to his secretary. Then it will go the Asst. Secretary, the Superintendent, the head clerk, the clerks and finally to the village officer. Then you will know the what I am trying to say.” </p>
    <p>Accordingly the ice cube passed from the Minister to the village officer one by one and by the time it reached the village officer, there was no ice cube at all. It has melted out on the way and only some drops of water was remaining.</p>
    <p>Raman said, “Maharaja, the large amount of money given by the Government, passing through many hands, when reaches the public melts all the way and when it reaches at the end there remains only some drops of water.”</p>
    <p>The Maharaj understood.</p>
