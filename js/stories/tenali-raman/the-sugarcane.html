    <p>The Maharaj gave much importanc to Tenali Raman. This caused the officers to graw a jealousy on him. They used to complain to the king about this. The king’s reply was only a smile.</p>
    <p>One day Tenali took leave and went to his relative’s house to attend a ceremony there. The king and with his ministers and high rank officers went around the city in disguise. When they reached a village they saw some villagers sitting and discussing under the shade of a banyan tree. The king went to them and asked, “We are strangers. We wish to know if your king looks after you well.”</p>
    <p>The villagers praised the king in unison. Then the king went to an old farmer and asked him the same question. Suddenly the villager left the place and returned in a few minutes with a long sugarcane in his hand. He broke the sugarcane and said, “Our king is like this.”</p>
    <p>The king was angry and before he spoke, another old man with a long beard and a turban came forward and said, “Please don't be angry, great king!What this old man, by breaking the sugarcane, intended to say was that the king was sour on the top and sweet in the middle. Before the king beggar to thank the old man, he took of his turban and false beard and lo, there stood nobody but his favourite Tenali Raman.</p>
    <p>“Maharaja,” said Tenali, “I am your servant always. How can I help you?” The king laughed heartily laughed.</p>
    <p>This is why I always like you” said the king and embraced Tenali Raman.</p>
